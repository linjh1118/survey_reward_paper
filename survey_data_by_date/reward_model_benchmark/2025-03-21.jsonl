While judge models -- LLMs\nfinetuned to specialize in assessing and critiquing model outputs -- have been\ntouted as general purpose evaluators, they are typically evaluated only on\nnon-contextual scenarios, such as instruction following. The omission of\ncontextual settings -- those where external information is used as context to\ngenerate an output -- is surprising given the increasing prevalence of\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and summarization use cases. Contextual\nassessment is uniquely challenging, as evaluation often depends on practitioner\npriorities, leading to conditional evaluation criteria (e.g., comparing\nresponses based on factuality and then considering completeness if they are\nequally factual). To address the gap, we propose ContextualJudgeBench, a judge\nbenchmark with 2,000 challenging response pairs across eight splits inspired by\nreal-world contextual evaluation scenarios.

In this paper, we introduce the\nDocVideoQA task and dataset for the first time, comprising 1454 videos across\n23 categories with a total duration of about 828 hours.

Initially, we establish a baseline using open-source MLLMs.\nRecognizing the challenges in modality comprehension for document-centric\nvideos, we present DV-LLaMA, a robust video MLLM baseline. Our method enhances\nunimodal feature extraction with diverse instruction-tuning data and employs\ncontrastive learning to strengthen modality integration. Through fine-tuning,\nthe LLM is equipped with audio-visual capabilities, leading to significant\nimprovements in document-centric video understanding. Extensive testing on the\nDocVideoQA dataset shows that DV-LLaMA significantly outperforms existing\nmodels.

Recent research has shown\nthat although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are initially poor at\nimage classification, fine-tuning them with an adequate amount of data can\nsignificantly enhance their performance, making them comparable to SOTA\nclassification models. However, acquiring large-scale labeled data is\nexpensive. In this paper, we explore few-shot MLLM classification fine-tuning.\nWe found that SFT can cause severe overfitting issues and may even degrade\nperformance over the zero-shot approach. To address this challenge, inspired by\nthe recent successes in rule-based reinforcement learning, we propose CLS-RL,\nwhich uses verifiable signals as reward to fine-tune MLLMs. We discovered that\nCLS-RL outperforms SFT in most datasets and has a much higher average accuracy\non both base-to-new and few-shot learning setting. Moreover, we observed a\nfree-lunch phenomenon for CLS-RL; when models are fine-tuned on a particular\ndataset, their performance on other distinct datasets may also improve over\nzero-shot models, even if those datasets differ in distribution and class\nnames. This suggests that RL-based methods effectively teach models the\nfundamentals of classification.

Although existing monocular\nclothed human reconstruction solutions have shown promising results, they often\nrely on the assumption that the human subject is in an occlusion-free\nenvironment. Thus, when encountering in-the-wild occluded images, these\nalgorithms produce multiview inconsistent and fragmented reconstructions.\nAdditionally, most algorithms for monocular 3D human reconstruction leverage\ngeometric priors such as SMPL annotations for training and inference, which are\nextremely challenging to acquire in real-world applications. To address these\nlimitations, we propose CHROME: Clothed Human Reconstruction with\nOcclusion-Resilience and Multiview-ConsistEncy from a Single Image, a novel\npipeline designed to reconstruct occlusion-resilient 3D humans with multiview\nconsistency from a single occluded image, without requiring either ground-truth\ngeometric prior annotations or 3D supervision. Specifically, CHROME leverages a\nmultiview diffusion model to first synthesize occlusion-free human images from\nthe occluded input, compatible with off-the-shelf pose control to explicitly\nenforce cross-view consistency during synthesis. A 3D reconstruction model is\nthen trained to predict a set of 3D Gaussians conditioned on both the occluded\ninput and synthesized views, aligning cross-view details to produce a cohesive\nand accurate 3D representation.

However, most of that success has built on\nhuman-specific body pose representations and extensive training with labeled\nreal videos. In this work, we extend the ability of such models to animate\nimages of characters with more diverse skeletal topologies. Given a small\nnumber (3-5) of example frames showing the character in different poses with\ncorresponding skeletal information, our model quickly infers a rig for that\ncharacter that can generate images corresponding to new skeleton poses. We\npropose a procedural data generation pipeline that efficiently samples training\ndata with diverse topologies on the fly. We use it, along with a novel skeleton\nrepresentation, to train our model on articulated shapes spanning a large space\nof textures and topologies. Then during fine-tuning, our model rapidly adapts\nto unseen target characters and generalizes well to rendering new poses, both\nfor realistic and more stylized cartoon appearances. To better evaluate\nperformance on this novel and challenging task, we create the first 2D video\ndataset that contains both humanoid and non-humanoid subjects with per-frame\nkeypoint annotations.
