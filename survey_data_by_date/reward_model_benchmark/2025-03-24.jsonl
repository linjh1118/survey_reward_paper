To meet\nmodeling requirements, autoregressive models possessing the characteristics of\nscalability and flexibility embrace a discrete-valued tokenizer, but face the\nchallenge of poor image generation quality. In contrast, diffusion models take\nadvantage of the continuous-valued tokenizer to achieve better generation\nquality but are subject to low efficiency and complexity. The existing hybrid\nmodels are mainly to compensate for information loss and simplify the diffusion\nlearning process. The potential of merging discrete-valued and\ncontinuous-valued tokens in the field of image generation has not yet been\nexplored. In this paper, we propose D2C, a novel two-stage method to enhance\nmodel generation capacity. In the first stage, the discrete-valued tokens\nrepresenting coarse-grained image features are sampled by employing a small\ndiscrete-valued generator. Then in the second stage, the continuous-valued\ntokens representing fine-grained image features are learned conditioned on the\ndiscrete token sequence. In addition, we design two kinds of fusion modules for\nseamless interaction. On the ImageNet-256 benchmark, extensive experiment\nresults validate that our model achieves superior performance compared with\nseveral continuous-valued and discrete-valued generative models on the\nclass-conditional image generation tasks.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["benchmark", "fine-grained"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-03-24.jsonl"}

We then pre-train a StyleUnet-based network to handle\ncomplex pose-dependent non-rigid deformation, which can capture high-frequency\nappearance details but is too resource-intensive for mobile devices. To\novercome this, we \"bake\" the non-rigid deformations into a lightweight\nMLP-based network using a distillation technique and develop blend shapes to\ncompensate for details.

The main idea of JailNTL is to disguise\nunauthorized data so it can be identified as authorized by the NTL model,\nthereby bypassing the non-transferable barrier without modifying the NTL model\nweights. Specifically, JailNTL encourages unauthorized-domain disguising in two\nlevels, including: (i) data-intrinsic disguising (DID) for eliminating domain\ndiscrepancy and preserving class-related content at the input-level, and (ii)\nmodel-guided disguising (MGD) for mitigating output-level statistics difference\nof the NTL model. Empirically, when attacking state-of-the-art (SOTA) NTL\nmodels in the black-box scenario, JailNTL achieves an accuracy increase of up\nto 55.7% in the unauthorized domain by using only 1% authorized samples,\nlargely exceeding existing SOTA white-box attacks.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["test-time"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["accuracy"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-03-24.jsonl"}

By contrast,\nit is challenging for diffusion models to be trained in an E2E fashion. This\npaper introduces a Deep End-to-End Posterior ENergy (DEEPEN) framework, which\nenables MAP estimation as well as sampling. We learn the parameters of the\nposterior, which is the sum of the data consistency error and the negative\nlog-prior distribution, using maximum likelihood optimization in an E2E\nfashion. The proposed approach does not require algorithm unrolling, and hence\nhas a smaller computational and memory footprint than current E2E methods,\nwhile it does not require contraction constraints typically needed by current\nPnP methods. Our results demonstrate that DEEPEN offers improved performance\nthan current E2E and PnP models in the MAP setting, while it also offers faster\nsampling compared to diffusion models. In addition, the learned energy-based\nmodel is observed to be more robust to changes in image acquisition settings.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["consistency"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-03-24.jsonl"}

This paper presents a Vision Transformer\n(ViT)-based semantic communication framework that has been deliberately\ndesigned to achieve high semantic similarity during image transmission while\nsimultaneously minimizing the demand for bandwidth. By equipping ViT as the\nencoder-decoder framework, the proposed architecture can proficiently encode\nimages into a high semantic content at the transmitter and precisely\nreconstruct the images, considering real-world fading and noise consideration\nat the receiver. Building on the attention mechanisms inherent to ViTs, our\nmodel outperforms Convolution Neural Network (CNNs) and Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (GANs) tailored for generating such images. The architecture based on\nthe proposed ViT network achieves the Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio (PSNR) of 38\ndB, which is higher than other Deep Learning (DL) approaches in maintaining\nsemantic similarity across different communication environments. These findings\nestablish our ViT-based approach as a significant breakthrough in semantic\ncommunications.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["accuracy"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-03-24.jsonl"}
