We demonstrate that preference optimization - a key step in the\nalignment phase - can inadvertently reduce the faithfulness of these\nexplanations. This occurs because the reward model (RM), which guides\nalignment, is tasked with optimizing both the expected quality of the response\nand the appropriateness of the explanations (e.g., minimizing bias or adhering\nto safety standards), creating potential conflicts. The RM lacks a mechanism to\nassess the consistency between the model's internal decision process and the\ngenerated explanation. Consequently, the LLM may engage in \"reward hacking\" by\nproducing a final response that scores highly while giving an explanation\ntailored to maximize reward rather than accurately reflecting its reasoning. To\naddress this issue, we propose enriching the RM's input with a causal\nattribution of the prediction, allowing the RM to detect discrepancies between\nthe generated self-explanation and the model's decision process.

As a result, downstream\ntasks such as driving virtual human in 3D scene or humanoid robots in real\nworld suffer from issues such as timing drift and jitter, spatial problems like\nsliding and penetration, and poor global trajectory accuracy. In this paper, we\nrevisit human MoCap from the perspective of interaction between human body and\nphysical world by exploring the role of pressure. Firstly, we construct a\nlarge-scale human Motion capture dataset with Pressure, RGB and Optical sensors\n(named MotionPRO), which comprises 70 volunteers performing 400 types of\nmotion, encompassing a total of 12.4M pose frames. Secondly, we examine both\nthe necessity and effectiveness of the pressure signal through two challenging\ntasks: (1) pose and trajectory estimation based solely on pressure: We propose\na network that incorporates a small kernel decoder and a long-short-term\nattention module, and proof that pressure could provide accurate global\ntrajectory and plausible lower body pose. (2) pose and trajectory estimation by\nfusing pressure and RGB: We impose constraints on orthographic similarity along\nthe camera axis and whole-body contact along the vertical axis to enhance the\ncross-attention strategy to fuse pressure and RGB feature maps. Experiments\ndemonstrate that fusing pressure with RGB features not only significantly\nimproves performance in terms of objective metrics, but also plausibly drives\nvirtual humans (SMPL) in 3D scene. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nincorporating physical perception enables humanoid robots to perform more\nprecise and stable actions, which is highly beneficial for the development of\nembodied artificial intelligence.
