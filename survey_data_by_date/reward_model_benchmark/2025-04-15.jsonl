Traditional\napproaches from the architecture domain, which are based on optimization\ntechniques or heuristic design guidelines, can synthesize desirable layouts,\nbut usually require post-processing and involve human interaction in the design\npipeline, making them costly and timeconsuming. The advent of deep generative\nmodels has significantly improved the fidelity and diversity of the generated\narchitecture layouts, reducing the workload by designers and making the process\nmuch more efficient. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of three\nmajor research topics of architecture layout design and generation: floorplan\nlayout generation, scene layout synthesis, and generation of some other formats\nof building layouts. For each topic, we present an overview of the leading\nparadigms, categorized either by research domains (architecture or machine\nlearning) or by user input conditions or constraints. We then introduce the\ncommonly-adopted benchmark datasets that are used to verify the effectiveness\nof the methods, as well as the corresponding evaluation metrics. Finally, we\nidentify the well-solved problems and limitations of existing approaches, then\npropose new perspectives as promising directions for future research in this\nimportant research area.

Furthermore, current attribute\nrecognition primarily focuses on analyzing pedestrians' external appearance and\nclothing, lacking an exploration of emotional dimensions. In this paper, we\nrevisit these issues and propose a novel multi-modal RGB-Event attribute\nrecognition task by drawing inspiration from the advantages of event cameras in\nlow-light, high-speed, and low-power consumption. Specifically, we introduce\nthe first large-scale multi-modal pedestrian attribute recognition dataset,\ntermed EventPAR, comprising 100K paired RGB-Event samples that cover 50\nattributes related to both appearance and six human emotions, diverse scenes,\nand various seasons. By retraining and evaluating mainstream PAR models on this\ndataset, we establish a comprehensive benchmark and provide a solid foundation\nfor future research in terms of data and algorithmic baselines. In addition, we\npropose a novel RWKV-based multi-modal pedestrian attribute recognition\nframework, featuring an RWKV visual encoder and an asymmetric RWKV fusion\nmodule.

Current methods address\nthese issues through retrieval-based techniques (grounding reasoning in\nexternal evidence), reasoning-based approaches (enhancing coherence via\nimproved prompting), or hybrid strategies combining both elements. One\nprominent hybrid method, ReAct, has outperformed purely retrieval-based or\nreasoning-based approaches; however, it lacks internal verification of\nintermediate reasoning steps, allowing potential errors to propagate through\ncomplex reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce Reasoning Court (RC), a\nnovel framework that extends iterative reasoning-and-retrieval methods, such as\nReAct, with a dedicated LLM judge. Unlike ReAct, RC employs this judge to\nindependently evaluate multiple candidate answers and their associated\nreasoning generated by separate LLM agents. The judge is asked to select the\nanswer that it considers the most factually grounded and logically coherent\nbased on the presented reasoning and evidence, or synthesizes a new answer\nusing available evidence and its pre-trained knowledge if all candidates are\ninadequate, flawed, or invalid.
