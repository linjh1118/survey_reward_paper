In diffusion-based T2V models, the attention mechanism is a\ncritical component. However, it remains unclear what intermediate features are\nlearned and how attention blocks in T2V models affect various aspects of video\nsynthesis, such as image quality and temporal consistency. In this paper, we\nconduct an in-depth perturbation analysis of the spatial and temporal attention\nblocks of T2V models using an information-theoretic approach. Our results\nindicate that temporal and spatial attention maps affect not only the timing\nand layout of the videos but also the complexity of spatiotemporal elements and\nthe aesthetic quality of the synthesized videos. Notably, high-entropy\nattention maps are often key elements linked to superior video quality, whereas\nlow-entropy attention maps are associated with the video's intra-frame\nstructure. Based on our findings, we propose two novel methods to enhance video\nquality and enable text-guided video editing. These methods rely entirely on\nlightweight manipulation of the attention matrices in T2V models. The efficacy\nand effectiveness of our methods are further validated through experimental\nevaluation across multiple datasets.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["evaluation", "consistency"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-04-17.jsonl"}

This study presents a comprehensive\nevaluation of radiomics-based and deep learning-based approaches for disease\ndetection in chest radiography, focusing on COVID-19, lung opacity, and viral\npneumonia. While deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), learn directly from image data,\nradiomics-based models extract and analyze quantitative features, potentially\nproviding advantages in data-limited scenarios. This study systematically\ncompares the diagnostic accuracy and robustness of various AI models, including\nDecision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines\n(SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for radiomics, against\nstate-of-the-art computer vision deep learning architectures. Performance\nmetrics across varying sample sizes reveal insights into each model's efficacy,\nhighlighting the contexts in which specific AI approaches may offer enhanced\ndiagnostic capabilities. The results aim to inform the integration of AI-driven\ndiagnostic tools in clinical practice, particularly in automated and\nhigh-throughput environments where timely, reliable diagnosis is critical. This\ncomparative study addresses an essential gap, establishing guidance for the\nselection of AI models based on clinical and operational needs.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["evaluation", "accuracy"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-04-17.jsonl"}

For the temporal features\nof fMRI, the local temporal attention enables to learn local BOLD signal\nfeatures with only simple window masking. For the spatial feature of fMRI,\nROI-rank based masking can distinguish ROIs with high correlation in ROI\nrelationships based on attention scores, thereby providing a more specific\nbiomarker for ADHD diagnosis. The experiment was conducted with various types\nof transformer models. To evaluate these models, we collected the data from 939\nindividuals from all sites provided by the ADHD-200 competition. Through this,\nthe spatiotemporal enhanced transformer for ADHD diagnosis outperforms the\nperformance of other different types of transformer variants.

However, the diversity of\nopen-world scenarios poses a major challenge for the generalization of such\nsystems to practical scenarios. Specifically, learned systems for scene\nmeasurement and state estimation tend to degrade when the application scenarios\ndeviate from the training data, resulting to unreliable depth and pose\nestimation. Toward addressing this problem, this work aims to develop a visual\nodometry system that can fast adapt to diverse novel environments in an online\nmanner. To this end, we construct a self-supervised online adaptation framework\nfor monocular visual odometry aided by an online-updated depth estimation\nmodule. Firstly, we design a monocular depth estimation network with\nlightweight refiner modules, which enables efficient online adaptation. Then,\nwe construct an objective for self-supervised learning of the depth estimation\nmodule based on the output of the visual odometry system and the contextual\nsemantic information of the scene. Specifically, a sparse depth densification\nmodule and a dynamic consistency enhancement module are proposed to leverage\ncamera poses and contextual semantics to generate pseudo-depths and valid masks\nfor the online adaptation. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness and\ngeneralization capability of the proposed method in comparison with\nstate-of-the-art learning-based approaches on urban, in-house datasets and a\nrobot platform.

In\nlight of this, we propose SemDiff, a novel unrestricted adversarial attack that\nexplores the semantic latent space of diffusion models for meaningful\nattributes, and devises a multi-attributes optimization approach to ensure\nattack success while maintaining the naturalness and imperceptibility of\ngenerated UAEs. We perform extensive experiments on four tasks on three\nhigh-resolution datasets, including CelebA-HQ, AFHQ and ImageNet.

Online source-free UDA has emerged\nas a solution for practical scenarios where access to source data is restricted\nand target data is received as a continuous stream. However, the open-world\nnature of many real-world applications additionally introduces category shifts\nmeaning that the source and target label spaces may differ. Online source-free\nuniversal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA) addresses this challenge. Existing\nmethods mainly rely on self-training with pseudo-labels, yet the relationship\nbetween pseudo-labeling and adaptation outcomes has not been studied yet. To\nbridge this gap, we conduct a systematic analysis through controlled\nexperiments with simulated pseudo-labeling, offering valuable insights into\npseudo-labeling for online SF-UniDA. Our findings reveal a substantial gap\nbetween the current state-of-the-art and the upper bound of adaptation achieved\nwith perfect pseudo-labeling. Moreover, we show that a contrastive loss enables\neffective adaptation even with moderate pseudo-label accuracy, while a\ncross-entropy loss, though less robust to pseudo-label errors, achieves\nsuperior results when pseudo-labeling approaches perfection. Lastly, our\nfindings indicate that pseudo-label accuracy is in general more crucial than\nquantity, suggesting that prioritizing fewer but high-confidence pseudo-labels\nis beneficial. Overall, our study highlights the critical role of\npseudo-labeling in (online) SF-UniDA and provides actionable insights to drive\nfuture advancements in the field.
