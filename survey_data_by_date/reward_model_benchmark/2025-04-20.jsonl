We introduce UniRig, a novel, unified framework for\nautomatic skeletal rigging that leverages the power of large autoregressive\nmodels and a bone-point cross-attention mechanism to generate both high-quality\nskeletons and skinning weights. Unlike previous methods that struggle with\ncomplex or non-standard topologies, UniRig accurately predicts topologically\nvalid skeleton structures thanks to a new Skeleton Tree Tokenization method\nthat efficiently encodes hierarchical relationships within the skeleton. To\ntrain and evaluate UniRig, we present Rig-XL, a new large-scale dataset of over\n14,000 rigged 3D models spanning a wide range of categories. UniRig\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art academic and commercial methods,\nachieving a 215% improvement in rigging accuracy and a 194% improvement in\nmotion accuracy on challenging datasets. Our method works seamlessly across\ndiverse object categories, from detailed anime characters to complex organic\nand inorganic structures, demonstrating its versatility and robustness. By\nautomating the tedious and time-consuming rigging process, UniRig has the\npotential to speed up animation pipelines with unprecedented ease and\nefficiency.

However, most existing methods require iterative optimization over\nper-view 2D semantic feature maps, which not only results in inefficiencies but\nalso leads to inconsistent 3D semantics across views. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce a training-free framework that constructs a\nsuperpoint graph directly from Gaussian primitives. The superpoint graph\npartitions the scene into spatially compact and semantically coherent regions,\nforming view-consistent 3D entities and providing a structured foundation for\nopen-vocabulary understanding. Based on the graph structure, we design an\nefficient reprojection strategy that lifts 2D semantic features onto the\nsuperpoints, avoiding costly multi-view iterative training. The resulting\nrepresentation ensures strong 3D semantic coherence and naturally supports\nhierarchical understanding, enabling both coarse- and fine-grained\nopen-vocabulary perception within a unified semantic field. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art\nopen-vocabulary segmentation performance, with semantic field reconstruction\ncompleted over $30\\times$ faster.

Drawing inspiration from cognitive science,\nwe investigate the combinational creativity of VLMs from the lens of concept\nblending. We propose the Identification-Explanation-Implication (IEI)\nframework, which decomposes creative processes into three levels: identifying\ninput spaces, extracting shared attributes, and deriving novel semantic\nimplications. To validate this framework, we curate CreativeMashup, a\nhigh-quality dataset of 666 artist-generated visual mashups annotated according\nto the IEI framework. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that in\ncomprehension tasks, best VLMs have surpassed average human performance while\nfalling short of expert-level understanding; in generation tasks, incorporating\nour IEI framework into the generation pipeline significantly enhances the\ncreative quality of VLMs outputs. Our findings establish both a theoretical\nfoundation for evaluating artificial creativity and practical guidelines for\nimproving creative generation in VLMs.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["dataset"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-04-20.jsonl"}
