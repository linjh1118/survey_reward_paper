To address these limitations,\nMS-Occ, a novel multi-stage LiDAR-camera fusion framework which includes\nmiddle-stage fusion and late-stage fusion, is proposed, integrating LiDAR's\ngeometric fidelity with camera-based semantic richness via hierarchical\ncross-modal fusion. The framework introduces innovations at two critical\nstages: (1) In the middle-stage feature fusion, the Gaussian-Geo module\nleverages Gaussian kernel rendering on sparse LiDAR depth maps to enhance 2D\nimage features with dense geometric priors, and the Semantic-Aware module\nenriches LiDAR voxels with semantic context via deformable cross-attention; (2)\nIn the late-stage voxel fusion, the Adaptive Fusion (AF) module dynamically\nbalances voxel features across modalities, while the High Classification\nConfidence Voxel Fusion (HCCVF) module resolves semantic inconsistencies using\nself-attention-based refinement.

To the best of our\nknowledge, the proposed work is the first tool that allows users to visualize\nand manipulate 3D objects interactively on a 2D real-world scene, along with a\ncomprehensive user study. This system supports robust 6D camera pose annotation\nby providing both visual cues and spatial relationships to determine object\nposition and orientation in various environments. The annotation feature in\nVision6D is particularly helpful in scenarios where the transformation matrix\nbetween the camera and world objects is unknown, as it enables accurate\nannotation of these objects' poses using only the camera intrinsic matrix. This\ncapability serves as a foundational step in developing and training advanced\npose estimation models across various domains. We evaluate Vision6D's\neffectiveness by utilizing widely-used open-source pose estimation datasets\nLinemod and HANDAL through comparisons between the default ground-truth camera\nposes with manual annotations. A user study was performed to show that Vision6D\ngenerates accurate pose annotations via visual cues in an intuitive 3D user\ninterface. This approach aims to bridge the gap between 2D scene projections\nand 3D scenes, offering an effective way for researchers and developers to\nsolve 6D pose annotation related problems.

We introduce a new,\neasy-to-implement framework for counterfactual images that can flexibly adapt\nto contemporary advances in generative modeling. Our method, Counterfactual\nAttacks, resembles an adversarial attack on the representation of the image\nalong a low-dimensional manifold. In addition, given an auxiliary dataset of\nimage descriptors, we show how to accompany counterfactuals with feature\nattribution that quantify the changes between the original and counterfactual\nimages. These importance scores can be aggregated into global counterfactual\nexplanations that highlight the overall features driving model predictions.\nWhile this unification is possible for any counterfactual method, it has\nparticular computational efficiency for ours.

The rapid advancement of deep learning offers an effective\nsolution for generating virtually stained images, significantly reducing the\ntime and labor costs associated with traditional histochemical staining.\nHowever, a new challenge arises in separating the fundamental visual\ncharacteristics of tissue sections from the visual differences induced by\nstaining agents. Additionally, virtual staining often overlooks essential\npathological knowledge and the physical properties of staining, resulting in\nonly style-level transfer. To address these issues, we introduce, for the first\ntime in virtual staining tasks, a pathological vision-language large model\n(VLM) as an auxiliary tool. We integrate contrastive learnable prompts,\nfoundational concept anchors for tissue sections, and staining-specific concept\nanchors to leverage the extensive knowledge of the pathological VLM. This\napproach is designed to describe, frame, and enhance the direction of virtual\nstaining. Furthermore, we have developed a data augmentation method based on\nthe constraints of the VLM. This method utilizes the VLM's powerful image\ninterpretation capabilities to further integrate image style and structural\ninformation, proving beneficial in high-precision pathological diagnostics.\nExtensive evaluations on publicly available multi-domain unpaired staining\ndatasets demonstrate that our method can generate highly realistic images and\nenhance the accuracy of downstream tasks, such as glomerular detection and\nsegmentation.
