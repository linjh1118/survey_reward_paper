Recently, although\nVideo Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) have made great progress in general\nvideo understanding tasks, their capabilities in video editing understanding\n(VEU) tasks remain unexplored. To address this gap, in this paper, we introduce\nVEU-Bench (Video Editing Understanding Benchmark), a comprehensive benchmark\nthat categorizes video editing components across various dimensions, from\nintra-frame features like shot size to inter-shot attributes such as cut types\nand transitions. Unlike previous video editing understanding benchmarks that\nfocus mainly on editing element classification, VEU-Bench encompasses 19\nfine-grained tasks across three stages: recognition, reasoning, and judging. To\nenhance the annotation of VEU automatically, we built an annotation pipeline\nintegrated with an ontology-based knowledge base. Through extensive experiments\nwith 11 state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs, our findings reveal that current Vid-LLMs\nface significant challenges in VEU tasks, with some performing worse than\nrandom choice. To alleviate this issue, we develop Oscars, a VEU expert model\nfine-tuned on the curated VEU-Bench dataset. It outperforms existing\nopen-source Vid-LLMs on VEU-Bench by over 28.3% in accuracy and achieves\nperformance comparable to commercial models like GPT-4o.
