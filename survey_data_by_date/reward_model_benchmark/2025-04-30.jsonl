This\nresearch adopts a novel perspective, focusing on evaluating the core\ncomputational reasoning ability of LLMs, defined as the capacity of model to\naccurately understand rules, and execute logically computing operations. This\ncapability assesses the reliability of LLMs as precise executors, and is\ncritical to advanced tasks such as complex code generation and multi-step\nproblem-solving. We propose an evaluation framework based on Universal Turing\nMachine (UTM) simulation. This framework requires LLMs to strictly follow\ninstructions and track dynamic states, such as tape content and read/write head\nposition, during multi-step computations. To enable standardized evaluation, we\ndeveloped TMBench, a benchmark for systematically studying the computational\nreasoning capabilities of LLMs. TMBench provides several key advantages,\nincluding knowledge-agnostic evaluation, adjustable difficulty, foundational\ncoverage through Turing machine encoding, and unlimited capacity for instance\ngeneration, ensuring scalability as models continue to evolve.

We further\npropose new annotation denoising auxiliary tasks with keypoints and DCT maps to\nenforce the RGB image extractor to learn fine-grained semantic information of\nhuman bodies.

Recent work on reconstructing\nthe 3D human body using 3DGS attempts to leverage prior information on human\npose to enhance rendering quality and improve training speed. However, it\nstruggles to effectively fit dynamic surface planes due to multi-view\ninconsistency and redundant Gaussians. This inconsistency arises because\nGaussian ellipsoids cannot accurately represent the surfaces of dynamic\nobjects, which hinders the rapid reconstruction of the dynamic human body.\nMeanwhile, the prevalence of redundant Gaussians means that the training time\nof these works is still not ideal for quickly fitting a dynamic human body. To\naddress these, we propose EfficientHuman, a model that quickly accomplishes the\ndynamic reconstruction of the human body using Articulated 2D Gaussian while\nensuring high rendering quality. The key innovation involves encoding Gaussian\nsplats as Articulated 2D Gaussian surfels in canonical space and then\ntransforming them to pose space via Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) to achieve\nefficient pose transformations. Unlike 3D Gaussians, Articulated 2D Gaussian\nsurfels can quickly conform to the dynamic human body while ensuring\nview-consistent geometries. Additionally, we introduce a pose calibration\nmodule and an LBS optimization module to achieve precise fitting of dynamic\nhuman poses, enhancing the model's performance.

Diagnosing these lesions is challenging due to their subtle imaging\nfeatures, often leading to reliance on invasive MRI arthrograms (MRAs). This\nstudy introduces ScopeMRI, the first publicly available, expert-annotated\ndataset for shoulder pathologies, and presents a deep learning (DL) framework\nfor detecting Bankart lesions on both standard MRIs and MRAs. ScopeMRI includes\n586 shoulder MRIs (335 standard, 251 MRAs) from 558 patients who underwent\narthroscopy. Ground truth labels were derived from intraoperative findings, the\ngold standard for diagnosis. Separate DL models for MRAs and standard MRIs were\ntrained using a combination of CNNs and transformers. Predictions from\nsagittal, axial, and coronal views were ensembled to optimize performance. The\nmodels were evaluated on a 20% hold-out test set (117 MRIs: 46 MRAs, 71\nstandard MRIs). The models achieved an AUC of 0.91 and 0.93, sensitivity of 83%\nand 94%, and specificity of 91% and 86% for standard MRIs and MRAs,\nrespectively. Notably, model performance on non-invasive standard MRIs matched\nor surpassed radiologists interpreting MRAs. External validation demonstrated\ninitial generalizability across imaging protocols. This study demonstrates that\nDL models can achieve radiologist-level diagnostic performance on standard\nMRIs, reducing the need for invasive MRAs. By releasing ScopeMRI and a modular\ncodebase for training and evaluating deep learning models on 3D medical imaging\ndata, we aim to accelerate research in musculoskeletal imaging and support the\ndevelopment of new datasets for clinically challenging diagnostic tasks.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["dataset"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-04-30.jsonl"}

The recent emergence of\nthe segment anything model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable adaptation in MIS\nbut cannot be directly applied to one-shot medical image segmentation (MIS) due\nto its reliance on labor-intensive user interactions and the high computational\ncost. To cope with these limitations, we propose a novel SAM-guided robust\nrepresentation learning framework, named RRL-MedSAM, to adapt SAM to one-shot\n3D MIS, which exploits the strong generalization capabilities of the SAM\nencoder to learn better feature representation. We devise a dual-stage\nknowledge distillation (DSKD) strategy to distill general knowledge between\nnatural and medical images from the foundation model to train a lightweight\nencoder, and then adopt a mutual exponential moving average (mutual-EMA) to\nupdate the weights of the general lightweight encoder and medical-specific\nencoder. Specifically, pseudo labels from the registration network are used to\nperform mutual supervision for such two encoders. Moreover, we introduce an\nauto-prompting (AP) segmentation decoder which adopts the mask generated from\nthe general lightweight model as a prompt to assist the medical-specific model\nin boosting the final segmentation performance. Extensive experiments conducted\non three public datasets, i.e., OASIS, CT-lung demonstrate that the proposed\nRRL-MedSAM outperforms state-of-the-art one-shot MIS methods for both\nsegmentation and registration tasks.

However, most existing RAG approaches are limited to a\ntext-only corpus, and while recent efforts have extended RAG to other\nmodalities such as images and videos, they typically operate over a single\nmodality-specific corpus. In contrast, real-world queries vary widely in the\ntype of knowledge they require, which a single type of knowledge source cannot\naddress. To address this, we introduce UniversalRAG, a novel RAG framework\ndesigned to retrieve and integrate knowledge from heterogeneous sources with\ndiverse modalities and granularities. Specifically, motivated by the\nobservation that forcing all modalities into a unified representation space\nderived from a single combined corpus causes a modality gap, where the\nretrieval tends to favor items from the same modality as the query, we propose\na modality-aware routing mechanism that dynamically identifies the most\nappropriate modality-specific corpus and performs targeted retrieval within it.\nAlso, beyond modality, we organize each modality into multiple granularity\nlevels, enabling fine-tuned retrieval tailored to the complexity and scope of\nthe query. We validate UniversalRAG on 8 benchmarks spanning multiple\nmodalities, showing its superiority over modality-specific and unified\nbaselines.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["accuracy"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-04-30.jsonl"}
