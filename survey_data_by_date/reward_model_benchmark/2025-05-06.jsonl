The new formulation is rooted on the following design principles: the\nmaterial energy functions are conservative by definition, they are formulated\non the high-dimensional membrane and bending domain to capture the complex\ninterplay of the different deformation modes, the material function domain is\nmaximally aligned with the training data, and the material parameters and the\noptimization are formulated on stress instead of energy for better correlation\nwith visual impact. The key novelty of our formulation is a new type of\nhigh-order RBF interpolant for polar coordinates, which allows us to fulfill\nall the design principles.

While recent\nadvancements have primarily focused on improving the model structure and\ntraining data of MRMs, there has been limited exploration into the\neffectiveness of long-term reasoning capabilities for reward modeling and how\nto activate these capabilities in MRMs. In this paper, we explore how\nReinforcement Learning (RL) can be used to improve reward modeling.\nSpecifically, we reformulate the reward modeling problem as a rule-based RL\ntask. However, we observe that directly applying existing RL algorithms, such\nas Reinforce++, to reward modeling often leads to training instability or even\ncollapse due to the inherent limitations of these algorithms. To address this\nissue, we propose the StableReinforce algorithm, which refines the training\nloss, advantage estimation strategy, and reward design of existing RL methods.\nThese refinements result in more stable training dynamics and superior\nperformance. To facilitate MRM training, we collect 200K preference data from\ndiverse datasets. Our reward model, R1-Reward, trained using the\nStableReinforce algorithm on this dataset, significantly improves performance\non multimodal reward modeling benchmarks.
