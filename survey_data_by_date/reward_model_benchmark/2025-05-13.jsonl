Standard evaluation of\ngenerated images often relies on no-reference image quality metrics when ground\ntruth images are unavailable, but their reliability in this complex domain is\nnot well established. This study comprehensively assesses commonly used\nno-reference image quality metrics using brain MRI data, including tumour and\nvascular images, providing a representative exemplar for the field. We\nsystematically evaluate metric sensitivity to a range of challenges, including\nnoise, distribution shifts, and, critically, localised morphological\nalterations designed to mimic clinically relevant inaccuracies. We then compare\nthese metric scores against model performance on a relevant downstream\nsegmentation task, analysing results across both controlled image perturbations\nand outputs from different generative model architectures. Our findings reveal\nsignificant limitations: many widely-used no-reference image quality metrics\ncorrelate poorly with downstream task suitability and exhibit a profound\ninsensitivity to localised anatomical details crucial for clinical validity.\nFurthermore, these metrics can yield misleading scores regarding distribution\nshifts, e.g. data memorisation. This reveals the risk of misjudging model\nreadiness, potentially leading to the deployment of flawed tools that could\ncompromise patient safety.

At its design core, we compose an autoregressive (AR) prior --\nmirroring the causal structure of language -- into visual tokens by using the\nreverse diffusion process of image generation. The AR property makes Selftok\nfundamentally distinct from traditional spatial tokens in the following two key\nways: - Selftok offers an elegant and minimalist approach to unify diffusion\nand AR for vision-language models (VLMs): By representing images with Selftok\ntokens, we can train a VLM using a purely discrete autoregressive architecture\n-- like that in LLMs -- without requiring additional modules or training\nobjectives. - We theoretically show that the AR prior satisfies the Bellman\nequation, whereas the spatial prior does not.

An approach to steer LLM behavior, such as\nmitigating biases or defending against jailbreaks, is to identify which parts\nof a prompt influence specific aspects of the model's output. Token-level\nattribution methods offer a promising solution, but still struggle in text\ngeneration, explaining the presence of each token in the output separately,\nrather than the underlying semantics of the entire LLM response. We introduce\nConceptX, a model-agnostic, concept-level explainability method that identifies\nthe concepts, i.e., semantically rich tokens in the prompt, and assigns them\nimportance based on the outputs' semantic similarity. Unlike current\ntoken-level methods, ConceptX also offers to preserve context integrity through\nin-place token replacements and supports flexible explanation goals, e.g.,\ngender bias. ConceptX enables both auditing, by uncovering sources of bias, and\nsteering, by modifying prompts to shift the sentiment or reduce the harmfulness\nof LLM responses, without requiring retraining. Across three LLMs, ConceptX\noutperforms token-level methods like TokenSHAP in both faithfulness and human\nalignment. Steering tasks boost sentiment shift by 0.252 versus 0.131 for\nrandom edits and lower attack success rates from 0.463 to 0.242, outperforming\nattribution and paraphrasing baselines. While prompt engineering and\nself-explaining methods sometimes yield safer responses, ConceptX offers a\ntransparent and faithful alternative for improving LLM safety and alignment,\ndemonstrating the practical value of attribution-based explainability in\nguiding LLM behavior.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["safety"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-05-13.jsonl"}

Traditional convolutional neural networks\ntypically process the entire images regardless of information density, leading\nto computational inefficiency and potential focus on irrelevant features. Our\napproach leverages a dynamic selection mechanism that uses coarse attention\ndistilled by fine multi-head attention from the downstream layers of the model,\nallowing the model to identify and extract the most salient k pixels, where k\nis adaptively learned during training based on loss convergence trends. Once\nthe top-k pixels are selected, the model processes only these pixels, embedding\nthem as words in a language model to capture their semantics, followed by\nmulti-head attention to incorporate global context. For biological cell images,\nwe demonstrate that SparseAttnNet can process approximately 15% of the pixels\ninstead of the full image. Applied to cell classification tasks using white\nblood cells images from the following modalities: optical path difference (OPD)\nimages from digital holography for stain-free cells, images from\nmotion-sensitive (event) camera from stain-free cells, and brightfield\nmicroscopy images of stained cells, For all three imaging modalities,\nSparseAttnNet achieves competitive accuracy while drastically reducing\ncomputational requirements in terms of both parameters and floating-point\noperations per second, compared to traditional CNNs and Vision Transformers.\nSince the model focuses on biologically relevant regions, it also offers\nimproved explainability. The adaptive and lightweight nature of SparseAttnNet\nmakes it ideal for deployment in resource-constrained and high-throughput\nsettings, including imaging flow cytometry.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["accuracy"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-05-13.jsonl"}

Website at https://dexwild.github.io", "summary": "Large-scale, diverse robot datasets have emerged as a promising path toward\nenabling dexterous manipulation policies to generalize to novel environments,\nbut acquiring such datasets presents many challenges. While teleoperation\nprovides high-fidelity datasets, its high cost limits its scalability. Instead,\nwhat if people could use their own hands, just as they do in everyday life, to\ncollect data? In DexWild, a diverse team of data collectors uses their hands to\ncollect hours of interactions across a multitude of environments and objects.\nTo record this data, we create DexWild-System, a low-cost, mobile, and\neasy-to-use device. The DexWild learning framework co-trains on both human and\nrobot demonstrations, leading to improved performance compared to training on\neach dataset individually. This combination results in robust robot policies\ncapable of generalizing to novel environments, tasks, and embodiments with\nminimal additional robot-specific data. Experimental results demonstrate that\nDexWild significantly improves performance, achieving a 68.5% success rate in\nunseen environments-nearly four times higher than policies trained with robot\ndata only-and offering 5.8x better cross-embodiment generalization.
