Specifically, we curate a\ncontrolled syllogistic reasoning dataset to disentangle formal validity from\ncontent plausibility. After localising the layers responsible for formal and\nmaterial inference, we investigate contrastive activation steering methods for\ntest-time interventions. An extensive empirical analysis on different LLMs\nreveals that contrastive steering consistently supports linear control over\ncontent biases.

While\nhigh-field MRI (HF-MRI) is standard in research and clinical settings, its\nlimited availability hinders widespread use. Low-field MRI (LF-MRI),\nparticularly portable systems, offers a cost-effective and accessible\nalternative. However, existing cortical surface analysis tools are optimized\nfor high-resolution HF-MRI and struggle with the lower signal-to-noise ratio\nand resolution of LF-MRI. In this work, we present a machine learning method\nfor 3D reconstruction and analysis of portable LF-MRI across a range of\ncontrasts and resolutions. Our method works \"out of the box\" without\nretraining. It uses a 3D U-Net trained on synthetic LF-MRI to predict signed\ndistance functions of cortical surfaces, followed by geometric processing to\nensure topological accuracy. We evaluate our method using paired HF/LF-MRI\nscans of the same subjects, showing that LF-MRI surface reconstruction accuracy\ndepends on acquisition parameters, including contrast type (T1 vs T2),\norientation (axial vs isotropic), and resolution. A 3mm isotropic T2-weighted\nscan acquired in under 4 minutes, yields strong agreement with HF-derived\nsurfaces: surface area correlates at r=0.96, cortical parcellations reach\nDice=0.98, and gray matter volume achieves r=0.93. Cortical thickness remains\nmore challenging with correlations up to r=0.70, reflecting the difficulty of\nsub-mm precision with 3mm voxels. We further validate our method on challenging\npostmortem LF-MRI, demonstrating its robustness. Our method represents a step\ntoward enabling cortical surface analysis on portable LF-MRI.

Recently, LLMs have been\nused to synthesize instruction data using seed question-answer (QA) pairs.\nHowever, these synthesized instructions often lack diversity and tend to be\nsimilar to the input seeds, limiting their applicability in real-world\nscenarios. To address this, we propose extracting instruction tuning data from\nweb corpora that contain rich and diverse knowledge. A naive solution is to\nretrieve domain-specific documents and extract all QA pairs from them, but this\nfaces two key challenges: (1) extracting all QA pairs using LLMs is\nprohibitively expensive, and (2) many extracted QA pairs may be irrelevant to\nthe downstream tasks, potentially degrading model performance. To tackle these\nissues, we introduce EQUAL, an effective and scalable data extraction framework\nthat iteratively alternates between document selection and high-quality QA pair\nextraction to enhance instruction tuning. EQUAL first clusters the document\ncorpus based on embeddings derived from contrastive learning, then uses a\nmulti-armed bandit strategy to efficiently identify clusters that are likely to\ncontain valuable QA pairs. This iterative approach significantly reduces\ncomputational cost while boosting model performance. Experiments on\nAutoMathText and StackOverflow across four downstream tasks show that EQUAL\nreduces computational costs by 5-10x and improves accuracy by 2.5 percent on\nLLaMA-3.1-8B and Mistral-7B", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["accuracy"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-05-20.jsonl"}

While existing LLMs often implement safeguards to avoid generating\nharmful or offensive outputs, R1 represents a notable shift - exhibiting\ncensorship-like behavior on politically charged queries. In this paper, we\ninvestigate this phenomenon by first introducing a large-scale set of heavily\ncurated prompts that get censored by R1, covering a range of politically\nsensitive topics, but are not censored by other models. We then conduct a\ncomprehensive analysis of R1's censorship patterns, examining their\nconsistency, triggers, and variations across topics, prompt phrasing, and\ncontext. Beyond English-language queries, we explore censorship behavior in\nother languages. We also investigate the transferability of censorship to\nmodels distilled from the R1 language model. Finally, we propose techniques for\nbypassing or removing this censorship. Our findings reveal possible additional\ncensorship integration likely shaped by design choices during training or\nalignment, raising concerns about transparency, bias, and governance in\nlanguage model deployment.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale", "o1"], "score": 2}, "reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["consistency"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-05-20.jsonl"}
