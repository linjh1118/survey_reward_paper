HF-VTON consists\nof three key modules: (1) the Appearance-Preserving Warp Alignment Module\n(APWAM), which aligns garments to human poses, addressing geometric\ndeformations and ensuring spatial consistency; (2) the Semantic Representation\nand Comprehension Module (SRCM), which captures fine-grained garment attributes\nand multi-pose data to enhance semantic representation, maintaining structural,\ntextural, and pattern consistency; and (3) the Multimodal Prior-Guided\nAppearance Generation Module (MPAGM), which integrates multimodal features and\nprior knowledge from pre-trained models to optimize appearance generation,\nensuring both semantic and geometric consistency. Additionally, to overcome\ndata limitations in existing benchmarks, we introduce the SAMP-VTONS dataset,\nfeaturing multi-pose pairs and rich textual annotations for a more\ncomprehensive evaluation.

We aim to\naddress class-incremental gesture recognition, which entails the ability to\naccommodate new and previously unseen gestures over time. Specifically, we\nintroduce a Prototype-Guided Pseudo Feature Replay (PGPFR) framework for\ndata-free class-incremental gesture recognition. This framework comprises four\ncomponents: Pseudo Feature Generation with Batch Prototypes (PFGBP),\nVariational Prototype Replay (VPR) for old classes, Truncated Cross-Entropy\n(TCE) for new classes, and Continual Classifier Re-Training (CCRT). To tackle\nthe issue of catastrophic forgetting, the PFGBP dynamically generates a\ndiversity of pseudo features in an online manner, leveraging class prototypes\nof old classes along with batch class prototypes of new classes. Furthermore,\nthe VPR enforces consistency between the classifier's weights and the\nprototypes of old classes, leveraging class prototypes and covariance matrices\nto enhance robustness and generalization capabilities. The TCE mitigates the\nimpact of domain differences of the classifier caused by pseudo features.\nFinally, the CCRT training strategy is designed to prevent overfitting to new\nclasses and ensure the stability of features extracted from old classes.\nExtensive experiments conducted on two widely used gesture recognition\ndatasets, namely SHREC 2017 3D and EgoGesture 3D, demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 11.8\\% and 12.8\\% in terms of\nmean global accuracy, respectively.

To improve\ndiagnostic efficiency and accuracy, deep learning-based methods such as\nConvolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers have been proposed for\nthe automatic classification of brain MRIs. However, despite their strong\npredictive performance, these models find limited clinical utility due to their\nopaque decision making. In this work, we propose a framework that integrates\ntwo core components to enhance diagnostic transparency. First, we introduce a\nmodular pipeline for converting 3D T1-weighted brain MRIs into textual\nradiology reports. Second, we explore the potential of modern Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to assist clinicians in the differential diagnosis between\nFrontotemporal dementia subtypes, Alzheimer's disease, and normal aging based\non the generated reports. To bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and\nexplainability, we employ reinforcement learning to incentivize diagnostic\nreasoning in LLMs. Without requiring supervised reasoning traces or\ndistillation from larger models, our approach enables the emergence of\nstructured diagnostic rationales grounded in neuroimaging findings. Unlike\npost-hoc explainability methods that retrospectively justify model decisions,\nour framework generates diagnostic rationales as part of the inference\nprocess-producing causally grounded explanations that inform and guide the\nmodel's decision-making process. In doing so, our framework matches the\ndiagnostic performance of existing deep learning methods while offering\nrationales that support its diagnostic conclusions.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["reinforcement learning"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["accuracy"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-05-27.jsonl"}

Yet existing diversity metrics often fall\nshort of this goal, relying on surface-level heuristics that are decoupled from\nmodel behavior. This motivates us to ask: What kind of diversity in training\ndata actually drives generalization in language models -- and how can we\nmeasure and amplify it? Through large-scale empirical analyses spanning over\n300 training runs, carefully controlled for data scale and quality, we show\nthat data diversity can be a strong predictor of generalization in LLM\nreasoning -- as measured by average model performance on unseen\nout-of-distribution benchmarks. We introduce G-Vendi, a metric that quantifies\ndiversity via the entropy of model-induced gradients. Despite using a small\noff-the-shelf proxy model for gradients, G-Vendi consistently outperforms\nalternative measures, achieving strong correlation (Spearman's $\\rho \\approx\n0.9$) with out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on both natural language\ninference (NLI) and math reasoning tasks. Building on this insight, we present\nPrismatic Synthesis, a framework for generating diverse synthetic data by\ntargeting underrepresented regions in gradient space. Experimental results show\nthat Prismatic Synthesis consistently improves model performance as we scale\nsynthetic data -- not just on in-distribution test but across unseen,\nout-of-distribution benchmarks -- significantly outperforming state-of-the-art\nmodels that rely on 20 times larger data generator than ours.

These models are typically adapted\nfrom text-based large language models (LLMs) through additional training on\naudio-related tasks. However, this adaptation process presents two major\nlimitations. First, ALLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where\nimportant textual capabilities such as instruction-following are lost after\ntraining on audio data. In some cases, models may even hallucinate sounds that\nare not present in the input audio, raising concerns about their reliability.\nSecond, achieving cross-modal alignment between audio and language typically\nrelies on large collections of task-specific question-answer pairs for\ninstruction tuning, making the process resource-intensive. To address these\nissues, we leverage the backbone LLMs from ALLMs to synthesize general-purpose\ncaption-style alignment data. We refer to this process as bootstrapping\naudio-language alignment via synthetic data generation from backbone LLMs\n(BALSa). Building on BALSa, we introduce LISTEN (Learning to Identify Sounds\nThrough Extended Negative Samples), a contrastive-like training method designed\nto improve ALLMs' ability to distinguish between present and absent sounds. We\nfurther extend BALSa to multi-audio scenarios, where the model either explains\nthe differences between audio inputs or produces a unified caption that\ndescribes them all, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. Experimental\nresults indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations\nwhile reliably maintaining strong performance in audio understanding,\nreasoning, and instruction-following skills.
