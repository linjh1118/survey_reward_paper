Despite\ntheir recent success in diverse downstream tasks, they struggle in tasks that\nrequires long context understanding and extrapolation to longer sequences. We\nobserve that these shortcomings come from three disjoint aspects in their\ndesign: (1) limited memory capacity that is bounded by the architecture of\nmemory and feature mapping of the input; (2) online nature of update, i.e.,\noptimizing the memory only with respect to the last input; and (3) less\nexpressive management of their fixed-size memory. To enhance all these three\naspects, we present ATLAS, a long-term memory module with high capacity that\nlearns to memorize the context by optimizing the memory based on the current\nand past tokens, overcoming the online nature of long-term memory models.\nBuilding on this insight, we present a new family of Transformer-like\narchitectures, called DeepTransformers, that are strict generalizations of the\noriginal Transformer architecture. Our experimental results on language\nmodeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive, and long-context\nunderstanding tasks show that ATLAS surpasses the performance of Transformers\nand recent linear recurrent models.

We start by designing\nthe tokenizer that converts images into sequences of discrete tokens, where\ntokens in different positions can be decoded into different diffusion denoising\nsteps in the pixel space. Thanks to the diffusion properties, these tokens\nnaturally follow a coarse-to-fine order, which directly lends itself to\nautoregressive modeling. Therefore, we apply standard next-token prediction on\nthese tokens, without modifying any underlying designs (either causal masks or\ntraining/inference strategies), and such sequential autoregressive token\ngeneration directly mirrors the diffusion procedure in image space. That is,\nonce the autoregressive model generates an increment of tokens, we can directly\ndecode these tokens into the corresponding diffusion denoising step in the\nstreaming manner. Our pipeline naturally reveals several intriguing properties,\nfor example, it supports consistent previews when generating only a subset of\ntokens and enables zero-shot layout-controlled synthesis. On the standard\nImageNet benchmark, our method achieves 2.09 FID using a 775M Llama backbone\nwith 256 discrete tokens.
