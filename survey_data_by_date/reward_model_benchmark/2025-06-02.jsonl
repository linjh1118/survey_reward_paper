In this work, we\nintroduce a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the zero-shot and few-shot\nperformance of state-of-the-art publicly available VLMs and MLLMs across six\nbiometric tasks spanning the face and iris modalities: face verification, soft\nbiometric attribute prediction (gender and race), iris recognition,\npresentation attack detection (PAD), and face manipulation detection (morphs\nand deepfakes). A total of 41 VLMs were used in this evaluation. Experiments\nshow that embeddings from these foundation models can be used for diverse\nbiometric tasks with varying degrees of success. For example, in the case of\nface verification, a True Match Rate (TMR) of 96.77 percent was obtained at a\nFalse Match Rate (FMR) of 1 percent on the Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW)\ndataset, without any fine-tuning. In the case of iris recognition, the TMR at 1\npercent FMR on the IITD-R-Full dataset was 97.55 percent without any\nfine-tuning.

We define this\nmissing capacity as Search Intensity Scaling (SIS)--the emergent skill to\nintensify search efforts under ambiguous or conflicting conditions, rather than\nsettling on overconfident, under-verification answers.\n  To study SIS, we introduce WebPuzzle, the first dataset designed to foster\ninformation-seeking behavior in open-world internet environments. WebPuzzle\nconsists of 24K training instances and 275 test questions spanning both\nwiki-based and open-web queries. Building on this dataset, we propose\nDeepDiver, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that promotes SIS by\nencouraging adaptive search policies through exploration under a real-world\nopen-web environment. Experimental results show that Pangu-7B-Reasoner\nempowered by DeepDiver achieve performance on real-web tasks comparable to the\n671B-parameter DeepSeek-R1. We detail DeepDiver's training curriculum from\ncold-start supervised fine-tuning to a carefully designed RL phase, and present\nthat its capability of SIS generalizes from closed-form QA to open-ended tasks\nsuch as long-form writing.

We\nincorporate emotions to effectively distinguish between different stance\ncategories by leveraging the emotional alignment or divergence between the\ntexts. We also employ label fusion that uses distance-metric learning to align\nextracted features with stance labels, improving the method's ability to\naccurately distinguish between stances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsignificant improvements achieved by SPLAENet over existing state-of-the-art\nmethods. SPLAENet demonstrates an average gain of 8.92\\% in accuracy and\n17.36\\% in F1-score on the RumourEval dataset. On the SemEval dataset, it\nachieves average gains of 7.02\\% in accuracy and 10.92\\% in F1-score. On the\nP-stance dataset, it demonstrates average gains of 10.03\\% in accuracy and\n11.18\\% in F1-score. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod for stance detection in the context of misinformative social media\ncontent.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["dataset", "accuracy"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-06-02.jsonl"}

The laborious\nand costly process of FACS coding has motivated the development of machine\nlearning frameworks for Action Unit (AU) detection. Despite intense efforts\nspanning three decades, the detection accuracy for many AUs is considered to be\nbelow the threshold needed for behavioral research. Also, many AUs are excluded\naltogether, making it impossible to fulfill the ultimate goal of FACS-the\nrepresentation of any facial expression in its entirety. This paper considers\nan alternative approach. Instead of creating automated tools that mimic FACS\nexperts, we propose to use a new coding system that mimics the key properties\nof FACS. Specifically, we construct a data-driven coding system called the\nFacial Basis, which contains units that correspond to localized and\ninterpretable 3D facial movements, and overcomes three structural limitations\nof automated FACS coding.

This fast\nweight, akin to recurrent states in RNNs, stores temporary memories of past\ntokens in the current sequence. Existing TTT methods struggled to show\neffectiveness in handling long-context data, due to their inefficiency on\nmodern GPUs. The TTT layers in many of these approaches operate with extremely\nlow FLOPs utilization (often <5%) because they deliberately apply small online\nminibatch sizes (e.g., updating fast weights every 16 or 64 tokens). Moreover,\na small minibatch implies fine-grained block-wise causal dependencies in the\ndata, unsuitable for data beyond 1D ordered sequences, like sets or\nN-dimensional grids such as images or videos. In contrast, we pursue the\nopposite direction by using an extremely large chunk update, ranging from 2K to\n1M tokens across tasks of varying modalities, which we refer to as Large Chunk\nTest-Time Training (LaCT).

Unlike optimization-based approaches that require costly bi-level\noptimization, distribution matching (DM) methods improve efficiency by aligning\nthe distributions of synthetic and original data, thereby eliminating nested\noptimization. DM achieves high computational efficiency and has emerged as a\npromising solution. However, existing DM methods, constrained to Euclidean\nspace, treat data as independent and identically distributed points,\noverlooking complex geometric and hierarchical relationships. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose a novel hyperbolic dataset distillation method, termed\nHDD. Hyperbolic space, characterized by negative curvature and exponential\nvolume growth with distance, naturally models hierarchical and tree-like\nstructures. HDD embeds features extracted by a shallow network into the Lorentz\nhyperbolic space, where the discrepancy between synthetic and original data is\nmeasured by the hyperbolic (geodesic) distance between their centroids. By\noptimizing this distance, the hierarchical structure is explicitly integrated\ninto the distillation process, guiding synthetic samples to gravitate towards\nthe root-centric regions of the original data distribution while preserving\ntheir underlying geometric characteristics. Furthermore, we find that pruning\nin hyperbolic space requires only 20% of the distilled core set to retain model\nperformance, while significantly improving training stability.

Hence, such oversimplification\nlimits LLMs from supporting personalization and pluralistic alignment.\nTheoretically, we show that when human preferences follow a mixture\ndistribution of diverse subgroups, a single BT model has an irreducible error.\nWhile existing solutions, such as multi-objective learning with fine-grained\nannotations, help address this issue, they are costly and constrained by\npredefined attributes, failing to fully capture the richness of human values.\nIn this work, we introduce MiCRo, a two-stage framework that enhances\npersonalized preference learning by leveraging large-scale binary preference\ndatasets without requiring explicit fine-grained annotations. In the first\nstage, MiCRo introduces context-aware mixture modeling approach to capture\ndiverse human preferences. In the second stage, MiCRo integrates an online\nrouting strategy that dynamically adapts mixture weights based on specific\ncontext to resolve ambiguity, allowing for efficient and scalable preference\nadaptation with minimal additional supervision.
