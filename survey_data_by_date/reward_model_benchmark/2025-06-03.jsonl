To support the R2SM task, we present\nthe R2SM dataset, constructed by augmenting annotations of COCOA-cls, D2SA, and\nMUVA. The R2SM dataset consists of both modal and amodal text queries, each\npaired with the corresponding ground-truth mask, enabling model finetuning and\nevaluation for the ability to segment images as per user intent. Specifically,\nthe task requires the model to interpret whether a given prompt refers to only\nthe visible part of an object or to its complete shape, including occluded\nregions, and then produce the appropriate segmentation. For example, if a\nprompt explicitly requests the whole shape of a partially hidden object, the\nmodel is expected to output an amodal mask that completes the occluded parts.\nIn contrast, prompts without explicit mention of hidden regions should generate\nstandard modal masks.

This paper\nintroduces PHYSICS, a dataset containing 16,568 high-quality physics problems\nspanning subjects and difficulty levels, to facilitate this issue.\nSpecifically, PHYSICS is curated with exercises from over 100 textbooks through\na carefully designed pipeline for quality control. It covers five major physics\ndomains: Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Thermodynamics, Optics, and Modern\nPhysics. It also spans a wide range of difficulty levels, from high school to\ngraduate-level physics courses. To utilize the data for improving and\nevaluating the model's physical reasoning capabilities, we split the dataset\ninto training and test sets, and provide reasoning paths generated by powerful\nreasoning models for the training data to facilitate model training. In\naddition, for the evaluation part, we find that existing evaluation frameworks\nexhibit biases in aspects such as units, simplification, and precision in\nphysics domain. To balance efficiency and accuracy, we introduce a Rule+Model\nevaluation framework tailored to physics problems.

Our key insight is that instead of learning directly from 3D\nscenes, we can leverage generated 2D images as an intermediary to guide 3D\nsynthesis. In light of this, we introduce ArtiScene, a training-free automated\npipeline for scene design that integrates the flexibility of free-form\ntext-to-image generation with the diversity and reliability of 2D intermediary\nlayouts.\n  First, we generate 2D images from a scene description, then extract the shape\nand appearance of objects to create 3D models.

To facilitate\nmulti-sensor fusion evaluation, we propose EarthMind-Bench, a comprehensive\nbenchmark with over 2,000 human-annotated multi-sensor image-question pairs,\ncovering a wide range of perception and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of EarthMind. It achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on EarthMind-Bench, surpassing GPT-4o despite being only 4B in\nscale.
