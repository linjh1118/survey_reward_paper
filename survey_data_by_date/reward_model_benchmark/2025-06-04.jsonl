Although significant progress has been made in semantic map\nconstruction and target direction prediction in current research, redundant\nexploration and exploration failures remain inevitable. A critical but\nunderexplored direction is the timely termination of exploration to overcome\nthese challenges. We observe a diminishing marginal effect between exploration\nsteps and exploration rates and analyze the cost-benefit relationship of\nexploration. Inspired by this, we propose RATE-Nav, a Region-Aware\nTermination-Enhanced method. It includes a geometric predictive region\nsegmentation algorithm and region-Based exploration estimation algorithm for\nexploration rate calculation. By leveraging the visual question answering\ncapabilities of visual language models (VLMs) and exploration rates enables\nefficient termination.RATE-Nav achieves a success rate of 67.8% and an SPL of\n31.3% on the HM3D dataset. And on the more challenging MP3D dataset, RATE-Nav\nshows approximately 10% improvement over previous zero-shot methods.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["dataset", "question answering"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-06-04.jsonl"}

These complexities significantly degrade the performance of\nstate-of-the-art tracking algorithms, highlighting the need for domain-specific\ndatasets. To address this gap, we introduce the Maritime Visual Tracking\nDataset (MVTD), a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark specifically\ndesigned for maritime VOT. MVTD comprises 182 high-resolution video sequences,\ntotaling approximately 150,000 frames, and includes four representative object\nclasses: boat, ship, sailboat, and unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The dataset\ncaptures a diverse range of operational conditions and maritime scenarios,\nreflecting the real-world complexities of maritime environments. We evaluated\n14 recent SOTA tracking algorithms on the MVTD benchmark and observed\nsubstantial performance degradation compared to their performance on\ngeneral-purpose datasets. However, when fine-tuned on MVTD, these models\ndemonstrate significant performance gains, underscoring the effectiveness of\ndomain adaptation and the importance of transfer learning in specialized\ntracking contexts. The MVTD dataset fills a critical gap in the visual tracking\ncommunity by providing a realistic and challenging benchmark for maritime\nscenarios.

First, there exists a gap between\nthe categories the system is meant to predict (woman versus man) and those onto\nwhich their output reasonably maps (female versus male).

In this work, we ask the question: what is the\nminimal set of general tools that can be used to achieve high performance\nacross a diverse set of tasks? Our answer is OpenHands-Versa, a generalist\nagent built with a modest number of general tools: code editing and execution,\nweb search, as well as multimodal web browsing and file access. Importantly,\nOpenHands-Versa demonstrates superior or competitive performance over leading\nspecialized agents across three diverse and challenging benchmarks: SWE-Bench\nMultimodal, GAIA, and The Agent Company, outperforming the best-performing\npreviously published results with absolute improvements in success rate of 9.1,\n1.3, and 9.1 points respectively. Further, we show how existing\nstate-of-the-art multi-agent systems fail to generalize beyond their target\ndomains. These results demonstrate the feasibility of developing a generalist\nagent to solve diverse tasks and establish OpenHands-Versa as a strong baseline\nfor future research.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["benchmark"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-06-04.jsonl"}

However, an important histopathological task, where GNNs have\nnot been extensively explored, is the classification of glomeruli health as an\nimportant indicator in nephropathology. This task presents unique difficulties,\nparticularly for the graph construction, i.e., the identification of nodes,\nedges, and informative features. In this work, we propose a pipeline composed\nof different traditional and machine learning-based computer vision techniques\nto identify nodes, edges, and their corresponding features to form a\nheterogeneous graph. We then proceed to propose a novel heterogeneous GNN\narchitecture for glomeruli classification, called HIEGNet, that integrates both\nglomeruli and their surrounding immune cells. Hence, HIEGNet is able to\nconsider the immune environment of each glomerulus in its classification. Our\nHIEGNet was trained and tested on a dataset of Whole Slide Images from kidney\ntransplant patients.
