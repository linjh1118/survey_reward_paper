While several VFM adapters have shown\npromising results by leveraging the prior knowledge of VFMs, we identify two\ninefficiencies in these approaches. First, the interaction between\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) and VFM backbone triggers early layer\ngradient backpropagation. Second, existing methods require tuning all\ncomponents, adding complexity. Besides, these adapters alter VFM features,\nunderutilizing the prior knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a\nnew approach called ViT-Split, based on a key observation: the layers of\nseveral VFMs, like DINOv2, can be divided into two distinct components: an\nextractor for learning low-level features and an adapter for learning\ntask-specific features. Leveraging this insight, we eliminate the CNN branch\nand introduce two heads, task head and prior head, to the frozen VFM. The task\nhead is designed to learn task-specific features, mitigating the early gradient\npropagation issue. The prior head is used to leverage the multi-scale prior\nfeatures from the frozen VFM, reducing tuning parameters and overfitting.\nExtensive experiments on various tasks (e.g., segmentation, detection, depth\nestimation, and visual question answering) validate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of ViT-Split.

We further propose an INP Coherence Loss to ensure\nINPs can faithfully represent normality for the testing image. These INPs then\nguide the INP-guided Decoder to reconstruct only normal tokens, with\nreconstruction errors serving as anomaly scores. Additionally, we propose a\nSoft Mining Loss to prioritize hard-to-optimize samples during training.\nINP-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-class, multi-class,\nand few-shot AD tasks across MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD, positioning it as a\nversatile and universal solution for AD. Remarkably, INP-Former also\ndemonstrates some zero-shot AD capability. Furthermore, we propose a soft\nversion of the INP Coherence Loss and enhance INP-Former by incorporating\nresidual learning, leading to the development of INP-Former++.

Previous methods often rely on task-specific\narchitectures (e.g., additional adapter modules) or dedicated customizations\n(e.g., DDIM inversion), which limit the integration of versatile editing\nconditions and the unification of various editing tasks. In this paper, we\nintroduce UNified In-Context Video Editing (UNIC), a simple yet effective\nframework that unifies diverse video editing tasks within a single model in an\nin-context manner. To achieve this unification, we represent the inputs of\nvarious video editing tasks as three types of tokens: the source video tokens,\nthe noisy video latent, and the multi-modal conditioning tokens that vary\naccording to the specific editing task. Based on this formulation, our key\ninsight is to integrate these three types into a single consecutive token\nsequence and jointly model them using the native attention operations of DiT,\nthereby eliminating the need for task-specific adapter designs. Nevertheless,\ndirect task unification under this framework is challenging, leading to severe\ntoken collisions and task confusion due to the varying video lengths and\ndiverse condition modalities across tasks. To address these, we introduce\ntask-aware RoPE to facilitate consistent temporal positional encoding, and\ncondition bias that enables the model to clearly differentiate different\nediting tasks. This allows our approach to adaptively perform different video\nediting tasks by referring the source video and varying condition tokens \"in\ncontext\", and support flexible task composition.

However, they remain limited by static training data,\nsusceptibility to hallucinations, and inability to verify claims against\nup-to-date, external evidence, compromising their performance in dynamic\nreal-world applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a\npractical solution to mitigate these challenges by allowing the LVLMs to access\nlarge-scale knowledge databases via retrieval mechanisms, thereby grounding\nmodel outputs in factual, contextually relevant information. Here in this\npaper, we conduct the first systematic dissection of the multimodal RAG\npipeline for LVLMs, explicitly investigating (1) the retrieval phase: on the\nmodality configurations and retrieval strategies, (2) the re-ranking stage: on\nstrategies to mitigate positional biases and improve the relevance of retrieved\nevidence, and (3) the generation phase: we further investigate how to best\nintegrate retrieved candidates into the final generation process. Finally, we\nextend to explore a unified agentic framework that integrates re-ranking and\ngeneration through self-reflection, enabling LVLMs to select relevant evidence\nand suppress irrelevant context dynamically. Our full-stack exploration of RAG\nfor LVLMs yields substantial insights, resulting in an average performance\nboost of 5% without any fine-tuning.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["ranking"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["question answering"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-06-05.jsonl"}
