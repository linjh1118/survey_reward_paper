In this paper, we\nintroduce MineInsight, a publicly available multi-sensor, multi-spectral\ndataset designed for off-road landmine detection. The dataset features 35\ndifferent targets (15 landmines and 20 commonly found objects) distributed\nalong three distinct tracks, providing a diverse and realistic testing\nenvironment. MineInsight is, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset to\nintegrate dual-view sensor scans from both an Unmanned Ground Vehicle and its\nrobotic arm, offering multiple viewpoints to mitigate occlusions and improve\nspatial awareness. It features two LiDARs, as well as images captured at\ndiverse spectral ranges, including visible (RGB, monochrome), visible\nshort-wave infrared (VIS-SWIR), and long-wave infrared (LWIR). Additionally,\nthe dataset comes with an estimation of the location of the targets, offering a\nbenchmark for evaluating detection algorithms. We recorded approximately one\nhour of data in both daylight and nighttime conditions, resulting in around\n38,000 RGB frames, 53,000 VIS-SWIR frames, and 108,000 LWIR frames. MineInsight\nserves as a benchmark for developing and evaluating landmine detection\nalgorithms.

In this work, inspired by stress\ntesting in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic\nRobustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that\nmaintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The\nAR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through\nmulti-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our\nframework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus\nminimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500\ndemonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also\nevaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro,\nand CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving\nthe effectiveness of AR-Checker.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["benchmark"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-06-06.jsonl"}
