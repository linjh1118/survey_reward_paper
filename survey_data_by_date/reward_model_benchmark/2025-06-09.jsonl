Modern\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in solving a wide range of mathematical problems. However, the\npotential of MLLMs as Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs), specifically in the\nmultimodal domain, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the\nMultimodal Automated Theorem Proving benchmark (MATP-BENCH), a new Multimodal,\nMulti-level, and Multi-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in this\nrole as multimodal automated theorem provers. MATP-BENCH consists of 1056\nmultimodal theorems drawn from high school, university, and competition-level\nmathematics. All these multimodal problems are accompanied by formalizations in\nLean 4, Coq and Isabelle, thus making the benchmark compatible with a wide\nrange of theorem-proving frameworks. MATP-BENCH requires models to integrate\nsophisticated visual understanding with mastery of a broad spectrum of\nmathematical knowledge and rigorous symbolic reasoning to generate formal\nproofs. We use MATP-BENCH to evaluate a variety of advanced multimodal language\nmodels. Existing methods can only solve a limited number of the MATP-BENCH\nproblems, indicating that this benchmark poses an open challenge for research\non automated theorem proving.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["benchmark"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-06-09.jsonl"}

However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video\nis composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long\nvideo, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human.\nWithout such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy\ntemporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding.
