In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as\nDINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks,\nrandom masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce\nregularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that\nindiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic\ninformation, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In\nthis study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation\nsetting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking\nexclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local\nviews and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This\ndesign leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean\nsupervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs.

Existing text-to-texture synthesis\napproaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate\nimages and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,\nthese approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across\nviewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized\ntextures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the\nautoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the\npredefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the\nobject's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized\nfrom different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In\nTexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that\nrepeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within\nthe diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on\nthese resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a\nfew training images restricts the model's original ability to generate\nhigh-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an\nperformance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve\nthe synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera\npositions based on the object's geometry.

In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields\nsuch as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.\nTraditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for\ndiffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted\nenergy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several\nchallenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping\nartifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when\nextended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy\nformulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based\ndensity-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.\nSpecifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and\ngeometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the\ntransformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates\nsuperior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior\nmethods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can\nbe easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it\ngeneralizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the\nmodel architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new\npossibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps\nfor practical applications.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["accuracy"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-06-13.jsonl"}

Specifically, we achieve\nreal-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the\nmatrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU\nreadings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption\nreduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides\ndiverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for\naccurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in\nreal time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS\nmatrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based\nmodel. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU\nreadings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method. To\nour knowledge, we are the first to achieve implicit IMU calibration (i.e.,\nseamlessly putting IMUs into use without the need for an explicit calibration\nprocess), as well as the first to enable long-term and accurate motion capture\nusing sparse IMUs.
