We consider a diverse set of chatbot manipulation contexts, from\nconsumer and personal advice to citizen advice and controversial proposition\nargumentation. Each conversation is annotated by human annotators for both\ngeneral manipulation and specific manipulation tactics. Our research reveals\nthree key findings. First, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be manipulative\nwhen explicitly instructed, with annotators identifying manipulation in\napproximately 84\\% of such conversations. Second, even when only instructed to\nbe ``persuasive'' without explicit manipulation prompts, LLMs frequently\ndefault to controversial manipulative strategies, particularly gaslighting and\nfear enhancement. Third, small fine-tuned open source models, such as\nBERT+BiLSTM have a performance comparable to zero-shot classification with\nlarger models like Gemini 2.5 pro in detecting manipulation, but are not yet\nreliable for real-world oversight. Our work provides important insights for AI\nsafety research and highlights the need of addressing manipulation risks as\nLLMs are increasingly deployed in consumer-facing applications.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["evaluation", "dataset", "safety"], "score": 3}}, "source_file": "2025-06-17.jsonl"}

Building upon our previous work on\nAdversarial Prompt Tuning (AdvPT), which introduced learnable text prompts to\nenhance adversarial robustness in VLMs without extensive parameter training, we\npresent a significant extension by introducing the Neural Augmentor framework\nfor Multi-modal Adversarial Prompt Tuning (NAP-Tuning).Our key innovations\ninclude: (1) extending AdvPT from text-only to multi-modal prompting across\nboth text and visual modalities, (2) expanding from single-layer to multi-layer\nprompt architectures, and (3) proposing a novel architecture-level redesign\nthrough our Neural Augmentor approach, which implements feature purification to\ndirectly address the distortions introduced by adversarial attacks in feature\nspace. Our NAP-Tuning approach incorporates token refiners that learn to\nreconstruct purified features through residual connections, allowing for\nmodality-specific and layer-specific feature correction.Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that NAP-Tuning significantly outperforms existing\nmethods across various datasets and attack types. Notably, our approach shows\nsignificant improvements over the strongest baselines under the challenging\nAutoAttack benchmark, outperforming them by 33.5% on ViT-B16 and 33.0% on\nViT-B32 architectures while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["benchmark", "accuracy"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-06-17.jsonl"}

This work\naims to address these challenges by proposing a novel multi-view X-ray/CT\nregistration method for intraoperative bone registration. Methods: The proposed\nregistration method consists of a multi-view, contour-based iterative closest\npoint (ICP) optimization. Unlike previous methods, which attempt to match bone\ncontours across the entire silhouette in both imaging modalities, we focus on\nmatching specific subcategories of contours corresponding to bone\nsubstructures.

To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that incorporates\naudio information into video TTA. Our method capitalizes on the rich semantic\ncontent of audio to generate audio-assisted pseudo-labels, a new concept in the\ncontext of video TTA. Specifically, we propose an audio-to-video label mapping\nmethod by first employing pre-trained audio models to classify audio signals\nextracted from videos and then mapping the audio-based predictions to video\nlabel spaces through large language models, thereby establishing a connection\nbetween the audio categories and video labels. To effectively leverage the\ngenerated pseudo-labels, we present a flexible adaptation cycle that determines\nthe optimal number of adaptation iterations for each sample, based on changes\nin loss and consistency across different views.

Despite some\nresearch efforts to tackle the challenge of overlapping object perception, most\nsolutions are confined to the spatial domain. Through frequency domain\nanalysis, we observe that the degradation of contours and textures due to the\noverlapping phenomenon can be intuitively reflected in the magnitude spectrum.\nBased on this observation, we propose a general Frequency-Optimized\nAnti-Overlapping Framework (FOAM) to assist the model in extracting more\ntexture and contour information, thereby enhancing the ability for\nanti-overlapping object perception. Specifically, we design the Frequency\nSpatial Transformer Block (FSTB), which can simultaneously extract features\nfrom both the frequency and spatial domains, helping the network capture more\ntexture features from the foreground. In addition, we introduce the\nHierarchical De-Corrupting (HDC) mechanism, which aligns adjacent features in\nthe separately constructed base branch and corruption branch using a specially\ndesigned consistent loss during the training phase. This mechanism suppresses\nthe response to irrelevant background features of FSTBs, thereby improving the\nperception of foreground contour.
