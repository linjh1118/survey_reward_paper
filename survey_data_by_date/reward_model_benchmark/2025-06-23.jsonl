The dataset includes healthy children as well as patients\ndiagnosed with AP or CP based on clinical criteria. Pediatric and general\nradiologists manually segmented the pancreas, then confirmed by a senior\npediatric radiologist. PanSegNet-generated segmentations were assessed using\nDice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance\n(HD95). Cohen's kappa measured observer agreement. Results: Pancreas MRI T2W\nscans were obtained from 42 children with AP/CP (mean age: 11.73 +/- 3.9 years)\nand 42 healthy children (mean age: 11.19 +/- 4.88 years). PanSegNet achieved\nDSC scores of 88% (controls), 81% (AP), and 80% (CP), with HD95 values of 3.98\nmm (controls), 9.85 mm (AP), and 15.67 mm (CP). Inter-observer kappa was 0.86\n(controls), 0.82 (pancreatitis), and intra-observer agreement reached 0.88 and\n0.81. Strong agreement was observed between automated and manual volumes (R^2 =\n0.85 in controls, 0.77 in diseased), demonstrating clinical reliability.\nConclusion: PanSegNet represents the first validated deep learning solution for\npancreatic MRI segmentation, achieving expert-level performance across healthy\nand diseased states.

It offers a large training set and evaluates\ngeneralization across three escalating challenges: in-distribution,\ncross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios. Using SEED-Bench-R1,\nwe find that standard GRPO, while improving answer accuracy, often reduces\nlogical coherence between reasoning steps and answers, with only a 57.9%\nconsistency rate. This stems from reward signals focusing solely on final\nanswers, encouraging shortcuts, and strict KL penalties limiting exploration.To\naddress this, we propose GRPO-CARE, a consistency-aware RL framework optimizing\nboth answer correctness and reasoning coherence without explicit supervision.\nGRPO-CARE introduces a two-tiered reward: (1) a base reward for answer\ncorrectness, and (2) an adaptive consistency bonus, computed by comparing the\nmodel's reasoning-to-answer likelihood (via a slowly-evolving reference model)\nagainst group peers.This dual mechanism amplifies rewards for reasoning paths\nthat are both correct and logically consistent. Replacing KL penalties with\nthis adaptive bonus, GRPO-CARE outperforms standard GRPO on SEED-Bench-R1,\nachieving a 6.7% performance gain on the hardest evaluation level and a 24.5%\nimprovement in consistency.

Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks.

When measuring agent ability to (a) complete the\nmain task, (b) complete the side task, and (c) avoid detection, we find that\nthe best performing frontier models score 27% (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) and 15%\n(Gemini 2.5 Pro) as sabotage agents when overseen by Claude 3.6 Sonnet. For\ncurrent frontier models, success on the side task relies heavily on having\naccess to a hidden scratchpad that is not visible to the monitor. We also use\nSHADE-Arena to measure models' monitoring abilities, with the top monitor\n(Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieving an AUC of 0.87 at distinguishing benign and malign\ntranscripts. We find that for now, models still struggle at sabotage due to\nfailures in long-context main task execution.

We achieve a\nPareto frontier between translation specialization and multilingual\ngeneral-purpose capabilities by introducing a novel training recipe that builds\non Tower (Alves et al., 2024), comprising continued pretraining, supervised\nfine-tuning, preference optimization, and reinforcement learning with\nverifiable rewards. At each stage of training, we carefully generate and curate\ndata to strengthen performance on translation as well as general-purpose tasks\ninvolving code generation, mathematics problem solving, and general\ninstruction-following. We develop models at multiple scales: 2B, 9B, and 72B.\nOur smaller models often outperform larger general-purpose open-weight and\nproprietary LLMs (e.g., Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o). Our largest model delivers\nbest-in-class translation performance for high-resource languages and top\nresults in multilingual Arena Hard evaluations and in IF-MT, a benchmark we\nintroduce for evaluating both translation and instruction-following. Our\nfindings highlight that it is possible to rival frontier models in general\ncapabilities, while optimizing for specific business domains, such as\ntranslation and localization.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "preference"], "score": 2}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["benchmark", "code generation"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-06-23.jsonl"}

It achieved higher accuracy with fewer parameters and lower\nfloating-point operations compared to existing TCN-based backend architectures.\nMoreover, visualization results suggest that our approach effectively utilizes\ndiverse temporal features while preserving temporal continuity, presenting\nnotable advantages in lipreading systems.

Existing studies typically formulated\ndifferent segmentation tasks in isolation, which overlooks the fundamental\ninterdependencies between these tasks, leading to suboptimal segmentation\nperformance and insufficient medical image understanding. To address this\nissue, we propose a Co-Seg++ framework for versatile medical segmentation.\nSpecifically, we introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing semantic\nand instance segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. We first devise\na spatio-temporal prompt encoder (STP-Encoder) to capture long-range spatial\nand temporal relationships between segmentation regions and image embeddings as\nprior spatial constraints. Moreover, we devise a multi-task collaborative\ndecoder (MTC-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen the\ncontextual consistency of both tasks, jointly computing semantic and instance\nsegmentation masks.

Many models have been developed to generate these\ncaptions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet,\nauthors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match\ntheir writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for\npersonalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances,\nthese technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address\nscenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces\nLaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal\nfigure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed\ninputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same\ndocument--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a\nprofile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using\nprofile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original\nauthor-written ones.

We present a curvature proxy that regularizes only the mixed\nsecond-order term (Weingarten term), allowing the two principal curvatures to\nadapt freely to data while suppressing unwanted warp. Two complementary\ninstantiations realize this idea: (i) a finite-difference proxy that replaces\neach Hessian entry with four forward SDF evaluations and a single first-order\ngradient, and (ii) an autodiff proxy that computes the same mixed derivative\nvia one Hessian-vector product, sidestepping explicit full Hessian assembly and\nremaining faster in practice. Both variants converge to the exact mixed second\nderivative, thus preserving the intended geometric bias without incurring full\nsecond-order graphs. On the ABC benchmarks, the proxies match or exceed the\nreconstruction fidelity of Hessian-based baselines while reducing GPU memory\nuse and wall-clock time by a factor of two.
