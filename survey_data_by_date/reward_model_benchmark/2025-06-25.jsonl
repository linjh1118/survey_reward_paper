Previous work\nwere mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some\npredefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of\nthe original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,\nthey largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of\nsubregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and\nsimilar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the\ncoarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the\ngraph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To\nthis end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in\nmulti-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive\ncoarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the\ncoarsening results and efficiency. Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive\ngranular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original\ngraph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal\ngranularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as\nsupernodes. In addition, compared with other state-of-the-art graph coarsening\nmethods, the processing speed of this method can be increased by tens to\nhundreds of times and has lower time complexity.

Objective: This study proposes and validates a novel\nSynthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance\nchanges for individual rare diseases following SC algorithm updates. Methods:\nWe used disease-phenotype annotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO),\na knowledge database for rare diseases, to generate synthetic vignettes.

The method's effectiveness was evaluated\nretrospectively by comparing estimated values with actual metric changes using\nthe R 2(R-squared) coefficient.

We empirically\nsubstantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal.

Traditional motion synthesis methods are either\nrestricted to fixed skeletal topologies or require costly optimization in\nhigh-dimensional deformation spaces. In contrast, AnimaX effectively transfers\nvideo-based motion knowledge to the 3D domain, supporting diverse articulated\nmeshes with arbitrary skeletons. Our method represents 3D motion as multi-view,\nmulti-frame 2D pose maps, and enables joint video-pose diffusion conditioned on\ntemplate renderings and a textual motion prompt. We introduce shared positional\nencodings and modality-aware embeddings to ensure spatial-temporal alignment\nbetween video and pose sequences, effectively transferring video priors to\nmotion generation task. The resulting multi-view pose sequences are\ntriangulated into 3D joint positions and converted into mesh animation via\ninverse kinematics. Trained on a newly curated dataset of 160,000 rigged\nsequences, AnimaX achieves state-of-the-art results on VBench in\ngeneralization, motion fidelity, and efficiency, offering a scalable solution\nfor category-agnostic 3D animation.
