We refer to\nthis vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation\ntechnologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior\nmodeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to\nseamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such\nas traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in\nvarious works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment\nsimulation have received less attention in the research community. We propose\nSceneDiffuser++, the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a\nsingle loss function capable of point A-to-B simulation on a city scale\nintegrating all the requirements above.

Applying the Decision\nTransformer to the auto-bidding task enables a unified approach to sequential\nmodeling, which efficiently overcomes short-sightedness by capturing long-term\ndependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior. Nevertheless,\nconventional DT has certain drawbacks: (1) DT necessitates a preset\nreturn-to-go (RTG) value before generating actions, which is not inherently\nproduced; (2) The policy learned by DT is restricted by its training data,\nwhich is consists of mixed-quality trajectories. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step\nprocess: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on\nstate and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the\ntraining set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training\nset) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the\ncurrent state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT,\nwe generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator)\nto augment our training dataset. This data enhancement has been shown to\nimprove the RTG of trajectories in the training data and gradually leads the\nsuboptimal policy towards optimality. Comprehensive tests on a publicly\navailable bidding dataset validate the R* DT's efficacy and highlight its\nsuperiority when dealing with mixed-quality trajectories.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["dataset"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-06-30.jsonl"}

In this work, we propose to accelerate CFM and introduce an\ninterpretable representation of its dynamics by integrating Koopman operator\ntheory, which models non-linear flows as linear evolution in a learned space of\nobservables. We introduce a decoder-free Koopman-CFM architecture that learns\nan embedding where the generative dynamics become linear, enabling closed-form,\none-step sampling via matrix exponentiation. This results in significant\nspeedups over traditional CFM as demonstrated on controlled 2D datasets and\nreal-world benchmarks, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST (F-MNIST), and the Toronto Face\nDataset (TFD). Unlike previous methods, our approach leads to a well-structured\nKoopman generator, whose spectral properties, eigenvalues, and eigenfunctions\noffer principled tools for analyzing generative behavior such as temporal\nscaling, mode stability, and decomposition in Koopman latent space. By\ncombining sampling efficiency with analytical structure, Koopman-enhanced flow\nmatching offers a potential step toward fast and interpretable generative\nmodeling.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scaling"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["dataset"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-06-30.jsonl"}

However, standard closed-set methods struggle to handle\nthe diverse objects and dynamic conditions encountered in real homes and labs.\nOpen-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), driven by Vision Language Models\n(VLMs), extends beyond fixed labels but still struggles with domain shifts in\nindoor environments. We introduce a Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA)\napproach that adapts a pre-trained model without accessing source data. We\nrefine pseudo labels via temporal clustering, employ multi-scale threshold\nfusion, and apply a Mean Teacher framework with contrastive learning. Our\nEmbodied Domain Adaptation for Object Detection (EDAOD) benchmark evaluates\nadaptation under sequential changes in lighting, layout, and object diversity.\nOur experiments show significant gains in zero-shot detection performance and\nflexible adaptation to dynamic indoor conditions.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["benchmark"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-06-30.jsonl"}

The culmination of this vision\nwould be a generative simulated city, where given a map of the city and an\nautonomous vehicle (AV) software stack, the simulator can seamlessly simulate\nthe trip from point A to point B by populating the city around the AV and\ncontrolling all aspects of the scene, from animating the dynamic agents (e.g.,\nvehicles, pedestrians) to controlling the traffic light states. We refer to\nthis vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation\ntechnologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior\nmodeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to\nseamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such\nas traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in\nvarious works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment\nsimulation have received less attention in the research community.

However, sampling from CFM still relies on numerically solving\nnon-linear ODEs which can be computationally expensive and difficult to\ninterpret. Recent alternatives address sampling speed via trajectory\nstraightening, mini-batch coupling or distillation. However, these methods\ntypically do not shed light on the underlying \\textit{structure} of the\ngenerative process. In this work, we propose to accelerate CFM and introduce an\ninterpretable representation of its dynamics by integrating Koopman operator\ntheory, which models non-linear flows as linear evolution in a learned space of\nobservables. We introduce a decoder-free Koopman-CFM architecture that learns\nan embedding where the generative dynamics become linear, enabling closed-form,\none-step sampling via matrix exponentiation. This results in significant\nspeedups over traditional CFM as demonstrated on controlled 2D datasets and\nreal-world benchmarks, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST (F-MNIST), and the Toronto Face\nDataset (TFD). Unlike previous methods, our approach leads to a well-structured\nKoopman generator, whose spectral properties, eigenvalues, and eigenfunctions\noffer principled tools for analyzing generative behavior such as temporal\nscaling, mode stability, and decomposition in Koopman latent space. By\ncombining sampling efficiency with analytical structure, Koopman-enhanced flow\nmatching offers a potential step toward fast and interpretable generative\nmodeling.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scaling"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["dataset"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-06-30.jsonl"}
