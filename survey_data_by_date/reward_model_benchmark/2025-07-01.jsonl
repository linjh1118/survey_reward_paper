Based on\nthe insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra\nbits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit\nallocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise\nallocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and\naccuracy can be improved.

To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths\nand temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle\ndifferent temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal\nlengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically\nformulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may\nincur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size\nrenewal mechanism to alleviate this issue.

PAC Bench features a diverse dataset with over 30,000 annotations,\ncomprising 673 real-world images (115 object classes, 15 property types, and 1\nto 3 affordances defined per class), 100 real-world humanoid-view scenarios,\nand 120 unique simulated constraint scenarios across four tasks.\n  Our evaluations reveal significant gaps in the ability of current VLMs to\ngrasp fundamental physical concepts, highlighting limitations in their\nsuitability for reliable robot manipulation and pointing to key areas for\ntargeted research. PAC Bench also serves as a standardized benchmark for\nrigorously evaluating physical reasoning in VLMs and guiding the development of\nmore robust, physically grounded models for robotic applications.\n  Project Page: https://pacbench.github.io/", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["benchmark", "dataset"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-07-01.jsonl"}

In PDE learning,\nadding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable\naccuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss.

EAGLE introduces four key\ninnovations: (1) dynamic cross-modal attention mechanisms that learn\nhierarchical relationships between modalities, (2) massive dimensionality\nreduction (99.96%) while maintaining predictive performance, (3) three\ncomplementary attribution methods providing patient-level interpretability, and\n(4) a unified pipeline enabling seamless adaptation across cancer types. We\nevaluated EAGLE on 911 patients across three distinct malignancies:\nglioblastoma (GBM, n=160), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN,\nn=171), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, n=580). Patient-level analysis\nshowed high-risk individuals relied more heavily on adverse imaging features,\nwhile low-risk patients demonstrated balanced modality contributions. Risk\nstratification identified clinically meaningful groups with 4-fold (GBM) to\n5-fold (NSCLC) differences in median survival, directly informing treatment\nintensity decisions. By combining state-of-the-art performance with clinical\ninterpretability, EAGLE bridges the gap between advanced AI capabilities and\npractical healthcare deployment, offering a scalable solution for multimodal\nsurvival prediction that enhances both prognostic accuracy and physician trust\nin automated predictions.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["accuracy"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-07-01.jsonl"}

In this paper, we present a method to solve\nthese two problems jointly from a sequence of observed point clouds of a single\narticulated object. The main challenge in our problem setting is that the point\nclouds are not assumed to be generated by a fixed set of moving points.\nInstead, each point cloud in the sequence could be an arbitrary sampling of the\nobject surface at that particular time step. Such scenarios occur when the\nobject undergoes major occlusions, or if the dataset is collected using\nmeasurements from multiple sensors asynchronously. In these scenarios, methods\nthat rely on tracking point correspondences are not appropriate. We present an\nalternative approach based on a compact but effective representation where we\nrepresent the object as a collection of simple building blocks modeled as 3D\nGaussians. We parameterize the Gaussians with time-dependent rotations,\ntranslations, and scales that are shared across all time steps. With our\nrepresentation, part segmentation can be achieved by building correspondences\nbetween the observed points and the Gaussians. Moreover, the transformation of\neach point across time can be obtained by following the poses of the assigned\nGaussian (even when the point is not observed).

Each robot predicts the RSSI\nfield of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are\nutilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative\nlocalization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations\nwith that of the neighbor robots.

As\na result, conventional robotic systems are often unable to provide effective\nescorting services due to their limited understanding of human movement\ndynamics. To address these challenges, an effective escorting robot must\ncontinuously detect and interpret human actions during the escorting process\nand adjust its movement accordingly. However, there is currently no existing\ndataset designed specifically for human action detection in the context of\nescorting.

Our key idea is to enhance\ndiffusion models with a training-free method that enables adaptive attention\nmanipulation and noise reinitialization by leveraging view-guided warping to\nensure view consistency. Through our comprehensive metric framework suitable\nfor novel-view datasets, we show that our method improves view consistency\nacross various diffusion models, demonstrating its broader applicability.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["consistency"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-07-01.jsonl"}

In this work, we instead propose a\nnovel approach that explicitly incorporates the underlying clustering\nassumption in SSL through extending a recently proposed differentiable\nclustering module. Leveraging annotated data to guide the cluster centroids\nresults in a simple end-to-end trainable deep SSL approach. We demonstrate that\nthe proposed model improves the performance over the supervised-only baseline\nand show that our framework can be used in conjunction with other SSL methods\nto further boost their performance.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["consistency"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-07-01.jsonl"}
