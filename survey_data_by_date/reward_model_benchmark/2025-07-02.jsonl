To simplify contrast\nidentification, broad labels such as T1-weighted or T2-weighted are commonly\nused, but these offer only a coarse approximation of the underlying acquisition\nsettings. In many real-world datasets, such labels are entirely missing,\nleaving raw acquisition parameters as the only indicators of contrast. Adding\nto this challenge, the available metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or\ninconsistent. The lack of reliable and standardized metadata complicates tasks\nsuch as image interpretation, retrieval, and integration into clinical\nworkflows. Furthermore, robust contrast-aware representations are essential to\nenable more advanced clinical applications, such as achieving\nmodality-invariant representations and data harmonization. To address these\nchallenges, we propose MR-CLIP, a multimodal contrastive learning framework\nthat aligns MR images with their DICOM metadata to learn contrast-aware\nrepresentations, without relying on manual labels. Trained on a diverse\nclinical dataset that spans various scanners and protocols, MR-CLIP captures\ncontrast variations across acquisitions and within scans, enabling\nanatomy-invariant representations.

Recently, masked time-series modeling\nhas been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by\nreconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic\ninformation in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations\ngenerated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series\nignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious\ntemporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal\nsemantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled\npatterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a\nmasked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which\nincludes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that\nincorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a\nperiod masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked\nseasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking\nstrategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar\nvariations. The proposed masking method presents an effective pre-training task\nfor learning intricate temporal variations and dependencies.

By treating each slide as a bag of patches,\nMultiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution\nfor WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high\nvariability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15\nAUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL\nmethods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight\ninitialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To\naddress that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL\nmethods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most\nstable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be\napplied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability. It also\nsimplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves reproducibility while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency. We extensively validate our approach on WSI\nclassification tasks using 2 different datasets, 3 initialization strategies\nand 5 MIL methods, for a total of more than 2000 experiments.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["annotation"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-07-02.jsonl"}

It\nthen generates multi-modal planning trajectories based on current scene\nfeatures and driving intentions and predicts multiple intention-driven future\nstates within the latent space. Finally, it introduces a world model selector\nmodule to evaluate and select the best trajectory. We achieve perception\nannotation-free, end-to-end planning through self-supervised alignment between\nactual future observations and predicted observations reconstructed from the\nlatent space. World4Drive achieves state-of-the-art performance without manual\nperception annotations on both the open-loop nuScenes and closed-loop NavSim\nbenchmarks, demonstrating an 18.1\\% relative reduction in L2 error, 46.7% lower\ncollision rate, and 3.75 faster training convergence.

Leveraging this, we propose UAVD-Mamba, a\nmultimodal UAV object detection framework based on Mamba architectures. To\nimprove geometric adaptability, we propose the Deformable Token Mamba Block\n(DTMB) to generate deformable tokens by incorporating adaptive patches from\ndeformable convolutions alongside normal patches from normal convolutions,\nwhich serve as the inputs to the Mamba Block. To optimize the multimodal\nfeature complementarity, we design two separate DTMBs for the RGB and infrared\n(IR) modalities, with the outputs from both DTMBs integrated into the Mamba\nBlock for feature extraction and into the Fusion Mamba Block for feature\nfusion. Additionally, to improve multiscale object detection, especially for\nsmall objects, we stack four DTMBs at different scales to produce multiscale\nfeature representations, which are then sent to the Detection Neck for Mamba\n(DNM). The DNM module, inspired by the YOLO series, includes modifications to\nthe SPPF and C3K2 of YOLOv11 to better handle the multiscale features.

Inspired by the\nrapid Binding and pattern separation mechanisms in the hippocampus, in this\nwork, we propose Bisecle for video-language continual learning, where a\nmulti-directional supervision module is used to capture more cross-modal\nrelationships and a contrastive prompt learning scheme is designed to isolate\ntask-specific knowledge to facilitate efficient memory storage. Binding and\nseparation processes further strengthen the ability of VLMs to retain complex\nexperiences, enabling robust and efficient continual learning in video\nunderstanding tasks. We perform a thorough evaluation of the proposed Bisecle,\ndemonstrating its ability to mitigate forgetting and enhance cross-task\ngeneralization on several VideoQA benchmarks.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["evaluation"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-07-02.jsonl"}

Despite the advancements in developing vision- and\nforce-based control methods for surgical robots, preoperative navigation\nremains heavily reliant on manual operation, limiting the consistency and\nincreasing the uncertainty. Existing eye gaze estimation techniques in the\nsurgery, whether traditional or deep learning-based, face challenges including\ndependence on additional sensors, occlusion issues in surgical environments,\nand the requirement for facial detection. To address these limitations, this\nstudy proposes an innovative eye localization and tracking method that combines\nmachine learning with traditional algorithms, eliminating the requirements of\nlandmarks and maintaining stable iris detection and gaze estimation under\nvarying lighting and shadow conditions.

However, most classifier guidance approaches are restricted to robust\nclassifiers, which were specifically trained on the noise of the diffusion\nforward process. We extend classifier guidance to work with general,\nnon-robust, classifiers that were trained without noise. We analyze the\nsensitivity of both non-robust and robust classifiers to noise of the diffusion\nprocess on the standard CelebA data set, the specialized SportBalls data set\nand the high-dimensional real-world CelebA-HQ data set. Our findings reveal\nthat non-robust classifiers exhibit significant accuracy degradation under\nnoisy conditions, leading to unstable guidance gradients. To mitigate these\nissues, we propose a method that utilizes one-step denoised image predictions\nand implements stabilization techniques inspired by stochastic optimization\nmethods, such as exponential moving averages.
