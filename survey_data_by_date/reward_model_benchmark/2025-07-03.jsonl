However, existing public datasets are\nprimarily composed of isolated text-video (T-V) pairs and thus fail to support\nthe modeling of coherent multi-clip video sequences. To address this\nlimitation, we introduce CI-VID, a dataset that moves beyond isolated\ntext-to-video (T2V) generation toward text-and-video-to-video (TV2V)\ngeneration, enabling models to produce coherent, multi-scene video sequences.\nCI-VID contains over 340,000 samples, each featuring a coherent sequence of\nvideo clips with text captions that capture both the individual content of each\nclip and the transitions between them, enabling visually and textually grounded\ngeneration. To further validate the effectiveness of CI-VID, we design a\ncomprehensive, multi-dimensional benchmark incorporating human evaluation,\nVLM-based assessment, and similarity-based metrics. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that models trained on CI-VID exhibit significant improvements in\nboth accuracy and content consistency when generating video sequences.

To address these issues, we\npropose an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics\ndata classification that aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy while\nminimizing testing costs. Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the\nactivation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution\nparameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and\nuncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of\na specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter\ncaptures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a\nmore trustworthy basis for decision-making.

Most of the current designs of motion\nprediction models are based on the major representation of lane centerlines,\nwhich limits their capability to capture critical road environments and traffic\nrules and constraints. In this work, we propose an enhanced motion forecasting\nmodel informed by multiple vector map elements, including lane boundaries and\nroad edges, that facilitates a richer and more complete representation of\ndriving environments. An effective feature fusion strategy is developed to\nmerge information in different vector map components, where the model learns\nholistic information on road structures and their interactions with agents.\nSince encoding more information about the road environment increases memory\nusage and is computationally expensive, we developed an effective pruning\nmechanism that filters the most relevant map connections to the target agent,\nensuring computational efficiency while maintaining essential spatial and\nsemantic relationships for accurate trajectory prediction. Overcoming the\nlimitations of lane centerline-based models, our method provides a more\ninformative and efficient representation of the driving environment and\nadvances the state of the art for autonomous vehicle motion forecasting. We\nverify our approach with extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 motion\nforecasting dataset, where our method maintains competitiveness on AV2 while\nachieving improved performance.\n  Index Terms-Autonomous driving, trajectory prediction, vector map elements,\nroad topology, connection pruning, Argoverse 2.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["dataset"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-07-03.jsonl"}

In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular\nmultimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0\nFlash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision\ntasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and\nsurface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and\nits variants, etc).\n  The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to\noutput text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or\n3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at\nan API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these\nchallenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable\nand API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized\nbenchmarking framework.\n  We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art\nspecialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists;\nthis is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based\ntasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4)\nWhile the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit\nless sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among\nnon-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6)\nreasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a\npreliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest\nGPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial\nmisalignments.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["benchmark"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-07-03.jsonl"}
