I demonstrate\nNL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the\nautomated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,\ninstruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models\nachieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal\nplans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions.

However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated\nmedical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,\nas a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective\nalternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble\nannotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks\nsufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for\ntraining segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel\nweakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key\ncomponents: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the\nboundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances\nfeature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity\ntransformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast\nvariations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by\nmasking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global\nanatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to\nrecover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper\nsemantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP\nmodule enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing\ndual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a\nboundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement.

Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data\nfrom one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in\nclinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary\nlengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient\nvariability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation\n(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain\nfragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this\nsetting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)\nframework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant\nrepresentations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific\nprompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming\nfragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation\nsince only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we\nfirst introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the\nprompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked\nconsistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model\nrepresentations.

Addressing these limitations, this study proposes a\nnovel approach by framing damage severity assessment as a semantic segmentation\nproblem, aiming for a more objective analysis of damage in earthquake-affected\nareas. The methodology involves the construction of a segmented damage severity\ndataset, categorizing damage into three degrees: undamaged structures, damaged\nstructures, and debris.
