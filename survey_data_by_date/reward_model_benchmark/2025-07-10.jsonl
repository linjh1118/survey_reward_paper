However, a\ndetailed examination reveals that these evaluation suites often comprise only a\nlimited number of homogeneous test cases, resulting in subtle faults going\nundetected. This not only artificially inflates measured performance but also\ncompromises accurate reward estimation in reinforcement learning frameworks\nutilizing verifiable rewards (RLVR). To address these critical shortcomings, we\nsystematically investigate the test-case generation (TCG) task by proposing\nmulti-dimensional metrics designed to rigorously quantify test-suite\nthoroughness. Furthermore, we introduce a human-LLM collaborative method\n(SAGA), leveraging human programming expertise with LLM reasoning capability,\naimed at significantly enhancing both the coverage and the quality of generated\ntest cases. In addition, we develop a TCGBench to facilitate the study of the\nTCG task. Experiments show that SAGA achieves a detection rate of 90.62% and a\nverifier accuracy of 32.58% on TCGBench. The Verifier Accuracy (Verifier Acc)\nof the code generation evaluation benchmark synthesized by SAGA is 10.78%\nhigher than that of LiveCodeBench-v6. These results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed method.

However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,\n'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we\nstudy the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,\nand overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a\nglobal context.\n  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first\nanalyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that\nwhile LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to\ndocumented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers\nof uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and\nMandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that\nwhile users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,\nreliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely\nsignificantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.\nTaken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident\nmodel generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of\nmultilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and\nlinguistically contextualized model safety evaluations.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["safety"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-07-10.jsonl"}

In this\nwork, we introduce a complete pipeline that converts English speech into\nsmooth, realistic 3D sign language animations.

Most advanced methods model agent interactions by efficiently\nfactorized attention based on the temporal and agent axes.

Alternatively, the\nmodern trajectory prediction framework refines the successive predictions by a\nfixed-anchor selection strategy, which is difficult to adapt in different\nfuture environments. It is acknowledged that human drivers dynamically adjust\ninitial driving decisions based on further assumptions about the intentions of\nsurrounding vehicles. Motivated by human driving behaviors, this paper proposes\nILNet, a multi-agent trajectory prediction method with Inverse Learning (IL)\nattention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module.
