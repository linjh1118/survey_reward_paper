This\nframework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current\nlimitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating\noptimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline\nto extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region\nsegmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.\nTo ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling\nstrategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid\n(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion\nconsistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,\nthereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In\naddition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively\nrefine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video\ngeneration.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation\nquality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian\nwhile with 150 FPS inference speed.

It is\nwell-known that without relevant contextual information, LLMs can provide poor\nquality responses or tend to hallucinate. Several initiatives have proposed\nintegrating LLMs with external tools to provide them with up-to-date data to\nimprove accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate external\ntools to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in answering queries in educational\nsettings. Precisely, we develop a framework that allows accessing external APIs\nto request additional relevant information. Integrated tools can also provide\ncomputational capabilities such as calculators or calendars. The proposed\nframework has been evaluated using datasets from the Multi-Modal Language\nUnderstanding (MMLU) collection. The data consists of questions on mathematical\nand scientific reasoning. Results compared to state-of-the-art language models\nshow that the proposed approach significantly improves performance. Our Athena\nframework achieves 83% accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 88% in scientific\nreasoning, substantially outperforming all tested models including GPT-4o,\nLLaMA-Large, Mistral-Large, Phi-Large, and GPT-3.5, with the best baseline\nmodel (LLaMA-Large) achieving only 67% and 79% respectively.

Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates\nclass-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data,\nadaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis\ntesting, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis\n(GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of\nnormalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment.\nWe establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving\ndatasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets.\nExtensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining\nefficiency.

First, we translate natural language into Knowledge Equations (KEs),\na novel language that we designed, theoretically grounded in assertional logic.\nNext, we convert them to target languages through rigorously defined rules that\npreserve both syntactic structure and semantic meaning.
