In the end, product attribution directly\nimpacts the 'discovery experience' of the customer. Although large language\nmodels (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding multimodal\ndata, their performance on fine-grained fashion attribute recognition remains\nunder-explored. This paper presents a zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art\nLLMs that balance performance with speed and cost efficiency, mainly\nGPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash. We have used the dataset\nDeepFashion-MultiModal (https://github.com/yumingj/DeepFashion-MultiModal) to\nevaluate these models in the attribution tasks of fashion products. Our study\nevaluates these models across 18 categories of fashion attributes, offering\ninsight into where these models excel. We only use images as the sole input for\nproduct information to create a constrained environment. Our analysis shows\nthat Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrates the strongest overall performance with a\nmacro F1 score of 56.79% across all attributes, while GPT-4o-mini scored a\nmacro F1 score of 43.28%. Through detailed error analysis, our findings provide\npractical insights for deploying these LLMs in production e-commerce product\nattribution-related tasks and highlight the need for domain-specific\nfine-tuning approaches.

An approach to mitigate this bottleneck\nis to leverage the inherent sparsity in the attention computation. In our\nanalysis of attention patterns in VLMs, we observe that a substantial portion\nof layers exhibit minimal cross-image attention, except through attention-sink\ntokens per image.

We evaluate the proposed technique using VLMs such as Qwen2-VL,\nQwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3.

Each task unfolds as a\nmulti-step trajectory, pairing first-person visual observations with high-level\ninstructions, grounded actions, and natural language rationales that express\nthe agent's intent at every step. Using EmRACE-3K, we establish a benchmark to\nevaluate the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs across three key\ndimensions: Exploration, Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning, and Multi-stage\nGoal Execution. In zero-shot settings, all models achieve success rates below\n20%, underscoring the challenge posed by our benchmark and the current\nlimitations of VLMs in interactive environments. To demonstrate the utility of\nEmRACE-3K, we further fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised learning\nfollowed by reinforcement learning.

Concurrently, we release KorFinSTS, a\n1,921-pair Korean financial STS benchmark spanning news, disclosures, research\nreports, and regulations, designed to expose nuances that general benchmarks\nmiss.\n  When evaluated against seven open-license baselines, NMIXX's multilingual\nbge-m3 variant achieves Spearman's rho gains of +0.10 on English FinSTS and\n+0.22 on KorFinSTS, outperforming its pre-adaptation checkpoint and surpassing\nother models by the largest margin, while revealing a modest trade-off in\ngeneral STS performance.

In an\neffort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can\nlikewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we\nperform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those\nrandom areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells. The resulting\nstyle-transferred data is then used to train semantic segmentation DNNs with\nthe objective of reducing their dependence on texture cues while enhancing\ntheir reliance on shape-based features.

However, previous\nworks have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into\nfeature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the\nfoundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image\nunderstanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings\nderived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the\noptimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective\nmechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image\nunderstanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle\nwhen addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we\nintroduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching\nwith a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant\nsolutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize\nglobal semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to\neffectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism\nin generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image\ninteraction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information\ninteraction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment,\nwe propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance\nscenarios.
