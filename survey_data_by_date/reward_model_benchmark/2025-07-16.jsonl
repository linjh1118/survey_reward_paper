Prior research\nhas shown that LLMs can extract similarities from analogy problems but lack\nrobust human-like reasoning. Building on Webb, Holyoak, and Lu (2023), the\ncurrent study focused on a story-based analogical mapping task and conducted a\nfine-grained evaluation of LLM reasoning abilities compared to human\nperformance. First, it explored the semantic representation of analogies in\nLLMs, using sentence embeddings to assess whether they capture the similarity\nbetween the source and target texts of an analogy, and the dissimilarity\nbetween the source and distractor texts. Second, it investigated the\neffectiveness of explicitly prompting LLMs to explain analogies. Throughout, we\nexamine whether LLMs exhibit similar performance profiles to those observed in\nhumans by evaluating their reasoning at the level of individual analogies, and\nnot just at the level of overall accuracy (as prior studies have done). Our\nexperiments include evaluating the impact of model size (8B vs. 70B parameters)\nand performance variation across state-of-the-art model architectures such as\nGPT-4 and LLaMA3.

In this paper, we propose FlowFSM, a novel agentic framework\nthat leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with prompt chaining and\nchain-of-thought reasoning to extract accurate FSMs from raw RFC documents.\nFlowFSM systematically processes protocol specifications, identifies state\ntransitions, and constructs structured rule-books by chaining agent outputs.\nExperimental evaluation across FTP and RTSP protocols demonstrates that FlowFSM\nachieves high extraction precision while minimizing hallucinated transitions,\nshowing promising results. Our findings highlight the potential of agent-based\nLLM systems in the advancement of protocol analysis and FSM inference for\ncybersecurity and reverse engineering applications.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["evaluation"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-07-16.jsonl"}

Limited datasets, peculiar domain-specific and TI modality-specific\nchallenges, i.e., limited hardware, scale invariance issues due to greater\ndistances, deliberate occlusion by tactical vehicles, lower sensor resolution\nand resultant lack of structural information in targets, effects of weather,\ntemperature, and time of day variations, and varying target to clutter ratios\nall result in increased intra-class variability and higher inter-class\nsimilarity, making accurate real-time ATR a challenging CV task. Resultantly,\ncontemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning architectures underperform\nin the ATR domain. We propose a modified anchor-based single-stage detector,\ncalled YOLOatr, based on a modified YOLOv5s, with optimal modifications to the\ndetection heads, feature fusion in the neck, and a custom augmentation profile.\nWe evaluate the performance of our proposed model on a comprehensive DSIAC MWIR\ndataset for real-time ATR over both correlated and decorrelated testing\nprotocols.

However,\ndecoding visual representations from EEG signals remains a significant\nchallenge due to their complex and noisy nature. We thus propose a novel\n5-stage framework for decoding visual representations from EEG signals: (1) an\nEEG encoder for concept classification, (2) cross-modal alignment of EEG and\ntext embeddings in CLIP feature space, (3) caption refinement via re-ranking,\n(4) weighted interpolation of concept and caption embeddings for richer\nsemantics, and (5) image generation using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model.\nWe enable context-aware EEG-to-image generation through cross-modal alignment\nand re-ranking.

Traditionally, it's judged by experts or measure by unique\nreference combinations. Both methods have limitations: experts have limited\nknowledge, and the effectiveness of the combination method is uncertain.\nMoreover, it's unclear if unique citations truly measure novelty. The large\nlanguage model (LLM) possesses a wealth of knowledge, while human experts\npossess judgment abilities that the LLM does not possess. Therefore, our\nresearch integrates the knowledge and abilities of LLM and human experts to\naddress the limitations of novelty assessment. The most common novelty in\nacademic papers is the introduction of new methods. In this paper, we propose\nleveraging human knowledge and LLM to assist pretrained language models (PLMs,\ne.g. BERT etc.) in predicting the method novelty of papers. Specifically, we\nextract sentences related to the novelty of the academic paper from peer review\nreports and use LLM to summarize the methodology section of the academic paper,\nwhich are then used to fine-tune PLMs. In addition, we have designed a\ntext-guided fusion module with novel Sparse-Attention to better integrate human\nand LLM knowledge.
