Our\napproach leverages person-level features as natural bridge points between\nvideos, enabling effective cross-video understanding without requiring\nend-to-end training. VideoForest integrates three key innovations: 1) a\nhuman-anchored feature extraction mechanism that employs ReID and tracking\nalgorithms to establish robust spatiotemporal relationships across multiple\nvideo sources; 2) a multi-granularity spanning tree structure that\nhierarchically organizes visual content around person-level trajectories; and\n3) a multi-agent reasoning framework that efficiently traverses this\nhierarchical structure to answer complex cross-video queries. To evaluate our\napproach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset\nspecifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis.

Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off:\nexplicit methods achieve geometric precision but struggle with ambiguous\nregions, while implicit methods provide robustness but suffer from slow\nconvergence. We present H3R, a hybrid framework that addresses this limitation\nby integrating volumetric latent fusion with attention-based feature\naggregation. Our framework consists of two complementary components: an\nefficient latent volume that enforces geometric consistency through epipolar\nconstraints, and a camera-aware Transformer that leverages Pl\\\"ucker\ncoordinates for adaptive correspondence refinement. By integrating both\nparadigms, our approach enhances generalization while converging 2$\\times$\nfaster than existing methods. Furthermore, we show that spatial-aligned\nfoundation models (e.g., SD-VAE) substantially outperform semantic-aligned\nmodels (e.g., DINOv2), resolving the mismatch between semantic representations\nand spatial reconstruction requirements. Our method supports variable-number\nand high-resolution input views while demonstrating robust cross-dataset\ngeneralization. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, with significant PSNR\nimprovements of 0.59 dB, 1.06 dB, and 0.22 dB on the RealEstate10K, ACID, and\nDTU datasets, respectively.

In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality\nsynthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles\nwhile preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression.

On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that\ncollective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent\nsystems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first\nstep towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the\ndifferent interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three\nprimary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent\nto multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model\n(MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance.\nBased on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively\nleverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced\ninference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent\nCollaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination\nof LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model\ncollaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a\ncurated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to\nselect the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking\n(PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that\nthe proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance.

Modeling user\nbehavior sequences as text to leverage Language Models (LMs) for this task has\ngained traction, owing to LMs' strong semantic understanding and contextual\nmodeling capabilities. However, a critical structural gap exists: user behavior\nsequences consist of discrete actions connected by semantically empty\nseparators, differing fundamentally from the coherent natural language in LM\npre-training. This mismatch causes semantic fragmentation, where LM attention\nscatters across irrelevant tokens instead of focusing on meaningful behavior\nboundaries and inter-behavior relationships, degrading prediction performance.\nTo address this, we propose $\\textit{CTR-Sink}$, a novel framework introducing\nbehavior-level attention sinks tailored for recommendation scenarios. Inspired\nby attention sink theory, it constructs attention focus sinks and dynamically\nregulates attention aggregation via external information. Specifically, we\ninsert sink tokens between consecutive behaviors, incorporating\nrecommendation-specific signals such as temporal distance to serve as stable\nattention sinks. To enhance generality, we design a two-stage training strategy\nthat explicitly guides LM attention toward sink tokens and a attention sink\nmechanism that amplifies inter-sink dependencies to better capture behavioral\ncorrelations.
