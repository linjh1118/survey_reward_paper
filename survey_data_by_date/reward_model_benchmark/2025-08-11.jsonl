Embodied navigation requires an agent to\nperceive, interact with, and adapt to its environment while moving toward a\nspecified target in unfamiliar settings. However, the integration of embodied\nnavigation into critical applications raises substantial safety concerns. Given\ntheir deployment in dynamic, real-world environments, ensuring the safety of\nsuch systems is critical. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of\nsafety in embodied navigation from multiple perspectives, encompassing attack\nstrategies, defense mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. Beyond conducting\na comprehensive examination of existing safety challenges, mitigation\ntechnologies, and various datasets and metrics that assess effectiveness and\nrobustness, we explore unresolved issues and future research directions in\nembodied navigation safety. These include potential attack methods, mitigation\nstrategies, more reliable evaluation techniques, and the implementation of\nverification frameworks. By addressing these critical gaps, this survey aims to\nprovide valuable insights that can guide future research toward the development\nof safer and more reliable embodied navigation systems. Furthermore, the\nfindings of this study have broader implications for enhancing societal safety\nand increasing industrial efficiency.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["evaluation", "safety"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-08-11.jsonl"}

Our approach applies adaptive depth\noffsetting, guided by depth variance thresholds, to generate synthetic depth\nperturbations while preserving structural integrity. We evaluate Depth-Jitter\non two benchmark datasets, FathomNet and UTDAC2020 demonstrating its impact on\nmodel stability under diverse depth conditions. Extensive experiments compare\nDepth-Jitter against traditional augmentation strategies such as ColorJitter,\nanalyzing performance across varying learning rates, encoders, and loss\nfunctions. While Depth-Jitter does not always outperform conventional methods\nin absolute performance, it consistently enhances model stability and\ngeneralization in depth-sensitive environments. These findings highlight the\npotential of depth-aware augmentation for real-world applications and provide a\nfoundation for further research into depth-based learning strategies.

This\nmakes FL a suitable learning paradigm for remote sensing (RS) image\nclassification tasks, where data centralization may be restricted due to legal\nand privacy constraints. However, a key challenge in applying FL to RS tasks is\nthe communication overhead caused by the frequent exchange of large model\nupdates between clients and the central server. To address this issue, in this\npaper we propose a novel strategy (denoted as FedX) that uses\nexplanation-guided pruning to reduce communication overhead by minimizing the\nsize of the transmitted models without compromising performance. FedX leverages\nbackpropagation-based explanation methods to estimate the task-specific\nimportance of model components and prunes the least relevant ones at the\ncentral server. The resulting sparse global model is then sent to clients,\nsubstantially reducing communication overhead. We evaluate FedX on multi-label\nscene classification using the BigEarthNet-S2 dataset and single-label scene\nclassification using the EuroSAT dataset. Experimental results show the success\nof FedX in significantly reducing the number of shared model parameters while\nenhancing the generalization capability of the global model, compared to both\nunpruned model and state-of-the-art pruning methods.
