However, Multi-Answer Question Answering (MAQA), where a\nquestion may have several valid answers, remains challenging.

Constructing datasets that reflect such conflicts is\ncostly and labor-intensive, while existing benchmarks often rely on synthetic\ndata, restrict the task to yes/no questions, or apply unverified automated\nannotation. To advance research in this area, we extend the conflict-aware MAQA\nsetting to require models not only to identify all valid answers, but also to\ndetect specific conflicting answer pairs, if any. To support this task, we\nintroduce a novel cost-effective methodology for leveraging fact-checking\ndatasets to construct NATCONFQA, a new benchmark for realistic, conflict-aware\nMAQA, enriched with detailed conflict labels, for all answer pairs.

We demonstrate that benchmarks with a better\nsignal-to-noise ratio are more reliable when making decisions at small scale,\nand those with less noise have lower scaling law prediction error. These\nresults suggest that improving signal or noise will lead to more useful\nbenchmarks, so we introduce three interventions designed to directly affect\nsignal or noise.

Recent advancements in multiple instance learning\nhave significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However,\nexisting methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial\nrelationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent\ninterpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges,\nwe propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel\nframework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and\nmodels their spatial dependencies across the tissue. IPGPhormer uniquely\nprovides interpretability at both tissue and cellular levels without requiring\npost-hoc manual annotations, enabling detailed analyses of individual WSIs and\ncross-cohort assessments. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in\nboth predictive accuracy and interpretability. In summary, our method,\nIPGPhormer, offers a promising tool for cancer prognosis assessment, paving the\nway for more reliable and interpretable decision-support systems in pathology.\nThe code is publicly available at\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/IPGPhormer-6EEB.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["benchmark", "accuracy"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-08-19.jsonl"}

Recent advancements in multiple instance learning\nhave significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However,\nexisting methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial\nrelationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent\ninterpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges,\nwe propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel\nframework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and\nmodels their spatial dependencies across the tissue. IPGPhormer uniquely\nprovides interpretability at both tissue and cellular levels without requiring\npost-hoc manual annotations, enabling detailed analyses of individual WSIs and\ncross-cohort assessments. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in\nboth predictive accuracy and interpretability. In summary, our method,\nIPGPhormer, offers a promising tool for cancer prognosis assessment, paving the\nway for more reliable and interpretable decision-support systems in pathology.\nThe code is publicly available at\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/IPGPhormer-6EEB.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["benchmark", "accuracy"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-08-19.jsonl"}

However, identifying the precise mechanisms or\ninternal structures within LLMs that allow successful ICL across diverse,\ndistinct classes of tasks remains elusive. Physics-based tasks offer a\npromising testbed for probing this challenge. Unlike synthetic sequences such\nas basic arithmetic or symbolic equations, physical systems provide\nexperimentally controllable, real-world data based on structured dynamics\ngrounded in fundamental principles. This makes them particularly suitable for\nstudying the emergent reasoning behaviors of LLMs in a realistic yet tractable\nsetting. Here, we mechanistically investigate the ICL ability of LLMs,\nespecially focusing on their ability to reason about physics. Using a dynamics\nforecasting task in physical systems as a proxy, we evaluate whether LLMs can\nlearn physics in context. We first show that the performance of dynamics\nforecasting in context improves with longer input contexts. To uncover how such\ncapability emerges in LLMs, we analyze the model's residual stream activations\nusing sparse autoencoders (SAEs). Our experiments reveal that the features\ncaptured by SAEs correlate with key physical variables, such as energy. These\nfindings demonstrate that meaningful physical concepts are encoded within LLMs\nduring in-context learning. In sum, our work provides a novel case study that\nbroadens our understanding of how LLMs learn in context.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["testbed"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-08-19.jsonl"}

Today, most algorithms focus on generating attack samples and do not\ntake into account the limited number of bona fide images. This work is one of\nthe first to propose a method for mimicking bona fide images by generating\nsynthetic versions of them using Stable Diffusion, which may help improve the\ngeneralisation capabilities of the detector. Furthermore, the new images\ngenerated are evaluated in a system trained from scratch and in a commercial\nsolution. The PAD system yields an interesting result, as it identifies our\nimages as bona fide, which has a positive impact on detection performance and\ndata restrictions.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["dataset"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-08-19.jsonl"}

A primary challenge arises from ambiguity\nintroduced during photometric reconstruction, particularly due to missing\ncorresponding pixels in ill-posed regions of the target view, such as\nocclusions and out-of-frame areas. To address this and establish explicit\nphotometric correspondences, we propose DMS, a model-agnostic approach that\nutilizes geometric priors from diffusion models to synthesize novel views along\nthe epipolar direction, guided by directional prompts. Specifically, we\nfinetune a Stable Diffusion model to simulate perspectives at key positions:\nleft-left view shifted from the left camera, right-right view shifted from the\nright camera, along with an additional novel view between the left and right\ncameras. These synthesized views supplement occluded pixels, enabling explicit\nphotometric reconstruction. Our proposed DMS is a cost-free, ''plug-and-play''\nmethod that seamlessly enhances self-supervised stereo matching and monocular\ndepth estimation, and relies solely on unlabeled stereo image pairs for both\ntraining and synthesizing.
