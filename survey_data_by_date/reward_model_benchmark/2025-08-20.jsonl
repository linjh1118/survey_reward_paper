Tracing evidence from which summaries are\nderived enables users to assess their accuracy, thereby alleviating this\nconcern. In this paper, we introduce TracSum, a novel benchmark for traceable,\naspect-based summarization, in which generated summaries are paired with\nsentence-level citations, enabling users to trace back to the original context.\nFirst, we annotate 500 medical abstracts for seven key medical aspects,\nyielding 3.5K summary-citation pairs. We then propose a fine-grained evaluation\nframework for this new task, designed to assess the completeness and\nconsistency of generated content using four metrics. Finally, we introduce a\nsummarization pipeline, Track-Then-Sum, which serves as a baseline method for\ncomparison. In experiments, we evaluate both this baseline and a set of LLMs on\nTracSum, and conduct a human evaluation to assess the evaluation results. The\nfindings demonstrate that TracSum can serve as an effective benchmark for\ntraceable, aspect-based summarization tasks. We also observe that explicitly\nperforming sentence-level tracking prior to summarization enhances generation\naccuracy, while incorporating the full context further improves completeness.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["comparison"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["benchmark", "evaluation", "consistency", "accuracy", "summarization", "aspect-based", "fine-grained"], "score": 7}}, "source_file": "2025-08-20.jsonl"}

This tendency is reinforced\nby preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction\nbut can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,\nsycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific\nquestion answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,\ndecision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this\nphenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by\nintroducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of\nsycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much\nuser-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates\nadversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading\nresistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to\nmaintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations\nacross open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic\ntendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size. To mitigate\nthis issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that\nfine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with\nchain-of-thought rationales. These rationales reject user misinformation while\nreinforcing factual commitments. Experiments on challenging scientific QA\nbenchmarks show that Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance\nwithout compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback, offering a\npractical pathway toward more truthful and principled model behavior.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["preference", "alignment"], "score": 2}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["evaluation", "truthfulness", "consistency", "accuracy", "dialogue", "question answering"], "score": 6}}, "source_file": "2025-08-20.jsonl"}

This bias\nallows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only\nthe vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question\n(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in\nvisual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the\nvisual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut\nfor VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To\nfix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates\nhard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it\nto the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these\nEOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)\nsettings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,\nproviding a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability.

To\nsystematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation\nframework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1)\ntheir knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify\ncorresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to\navoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical\nperformance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:\nwhile agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\\%$ pass rates), they\nfail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with\nperformance dropping by $>23\\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\\%$\npass rates).

Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are\ncompared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based\nmethods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior\nperformance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,\nwith no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement\nlevels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern\nrecognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by\nin-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.\nThis approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in\ndigital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for\npatient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health\nstrategies.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["agreement"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-08-20.jsonl"}

Non-rigid\nregistration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template\n(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information\nfrom multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of\nknown use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and\nregistration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such\nmulti-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection\nof perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be\nregistered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach\nwhere the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D\npoint in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a\ndirection vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation\nw.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from\ncorrespondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,\nthese form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised\ncameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved\nreconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the\nadditional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a\ndeformed object.

Previous studies have employed dense SLAM\ntechniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.\nHowever, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which\nare insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete\nreconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires\nincorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.\nHowever, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive\ntraining iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS\nmodeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By\nanalyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal\nnon-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and\nselected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse\nviewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework\nthat incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in\n3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process.
