We present a deep\nlearning framework that enhances the SaRa (Saliency Ranking) model with\nDeepGaze IIE, improving Salient Object Ranking (SOR) performance by 10.7%. Our\nframework optimizes three key components: saliency map generation, grid segment\nscoring, and map normalization. Through a two-fold experiment using\neye-tracking (30 participants) and mouse-tracking (375 participants aged\n13--70), we analyze attention patterns across demographic groups. Statistical\nanalysis reveals significant age-based variations (p < 0.05, {\\epsilon^2} =\n0.042), with older users (36--70) engaging more with textual content and\nyounger users (13--35) interacting more with images. Mouse-tracking data\nclosely approximates eye-tracking behavior (sAUC = 0.86) and identifies UI\nelements that immediately stand out, validating its use in large-scale studies.\nWe conclude that saliency studies should prioritize gathering data from a\nlarger, demographically representative sample and report exact demographic\ndistributions.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["ranking"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-03-24.jsonl"}
