While existing\nmethods primarily focus on spatial alignment between LiDAR and camera sensors,\nthey often overlook the temporal dynamics critical for capturing motion and\nscene continuity in driving scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose\nSuperFlow++, a novel framework that integrates spatiotemporal cues in both\npretraining and downstream tasks using consecutive LiDAR-camera pairs.\nSuperFlow++ introduces four key components: (1) a view consistency alignment\nmodule to unify semantic information across camera views, (2) a dense-to-sparse\nconsistency regularization mechanism to enhance feature robustness across\nvarying point cloud densities, (3) a flow-based contrastive learning approach\nthat models temporal relationships for improved scene understanding, and (4) a\ntemporal voting strategy that propagates semantic information across LiDAR\nscans to improve prediction consistency. Extensive evaluations on 11\nheterogeneous LiDAR datasets demonstrate that SuperFlow++ outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods across diverse tasks and driving conditions.\nFurthermore, by scaling both 2D and 3D backbones during pretraining, we uncover\nemergent properties that provide deeper insights into developing scalable 3D\nfoundation models. With strong generalizability and computational efficiency,\nSuperFlow++ establishes a new benchmark for data-efficient LiDAR-based\nperception in autonomous driving.
