However, existing test-time search methods using a\nreward model (RM) often degrade in quality as compute scales, due to the\nover-optimization of what are inherently imperfect reward proxies. We introduce\nQAlign, a new test-time alignment approach. As we scale test-time compute,\nQAlign converges to sampling from the optimal aligned distribution for each\nindividual prompt. By adopting recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo for\ntext generation, our method enables better-aligned outputs without modifying\nthe underlying model or even requiring logit access. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of QAlign on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K and\nGSM-Symbolic) using a task-specific RM, showing consistent improvements over\nexisting test-time compute methods like best-of-n and majority voting.\nFurthermore, when applied with more realistic RMs trained on the Tulu 3\npreference dataset, QAlign outperforms direct preference optimization (DPO),\nbest-of-n, majority voting, and weighted majority voting on a diverse range of\ndatasets (GSM8K, MATH500, IFEval, MMLU-Redux, and TruthfulQA).

It is a\ntotally attention free method which offers easy integration to the main stream\ninference platform and comparable performance comparing to other complicated KV\ncompression methods. Results on LongBench and PasskeyRetrieval show that, our\napproach achieves nearly zero loss when the ratio is $2\\times$ and $\\approx\n90\\%$ of the original model performance for $8\\times$. Especially in the\n64-digit passkey retrieval task, our mehod outperforms the attention weight\nbased method $H_2O$ over $60\\%$ with same compression ratios.
