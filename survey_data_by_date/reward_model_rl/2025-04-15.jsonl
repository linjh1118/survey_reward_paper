In this survey, we categorize existing methods along two orthogonal\ndimensions: (1) Regimes, which define the stage at which reasoning is achieved\n(either at inference time or through dedicated training); and (2)\nArchitectures, which determine the components involved in the reasoning\nprocess, distinguishing between standalone LLMs and agentic compound systems\nthat incorporate external tools, and multi-agent collaborations. Within each\ndimension, we analyze two key perspectives: (1) Input level, which focuses on\ntechniques that construct high-quality prompts that the LLM condition on; and\n(2) Output level, which methods that refine multiple sampled candidates to\nenhance reasoning quality. This categorization provides a systematic\nunderstanding of the evolving landscape of LLM reasoning, highlighting emerging\ntrends such as the shift from inference-scaling to learning-to-reason (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-R1), and the transition to agentic workflows (e.g., OpenAI Deep\nResearch, Manus Agent). Additionally, we cover a broad spectrum of learning\nalgorithms, from supervised fine-tuning to reinforcement learning such as PPO\nand GRPO, and the training of reasoners and verifiers. We also examine key\ndesigns of agentic workflows, from established patterns like\ngenerator-evaluator and LLM debate to recent innovations. ...", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["inference time", "scaling"], "score": 2}, "reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["PPO", "reinforcement learning"], "score": 2}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["dimension"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-04-15.jsonl"}
