One of the root causes for these limitations is that the\ndistributions from the teacher and the student for KD are output by different\nprediction heads, which yield distributions in different output spaces and\ndimensions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dual-space knowledge\ndistillation (DSKD) framework that unifies the prediction heads of the teacher\nand the student models for KD.

In the context of weak supervision,\nclinician gaze data captures regions of diagnostic interest; however, its\nsparsity limits its use for segmentation.

Recognizing that neither source alone suffices,\nwe propose a teacher-student framework that integrates both gaze and language\nsupervision, leveraging their complementary strengths. Our key insight is that\ngaze data indicates where clinicians focus during diagnosis, while VLMs explain\nwhy those regions are significant. To implement this, the teacher model first\nlearns from gaze points enhanced by VLM-generated descriptions of lesion\nmorphology, establishing a foundation for guiding the student model.
