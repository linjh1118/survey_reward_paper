However, a key challenge\nremains the lack of high-quality pseudo-labeled data. Current pseudo-labeling\nstrategies often struggle with mismatches between semantic and visual\ninformation, leading to sub-optimal performance of unsupervised prompt learning\n(UPL) methods. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective approach\ncalled \\textbf{A}ugmenting D\\textbf{i}scriminative \\textbf{R}ichness via\nDiffusions (AiR), toward learning a richer discriminating way to represent the\nclass comprehensively and thus facilitate classification. Specifically, our\napproach includes a pseudo-label generation module that leverages high-fidelity\nsynthetic samples to create an auxiliary classifier, which captures richer\nvisual variation, bridging text-image-pair classification to a more robust\nimage-image-pair classification. Additionally, we exploit the diversity of\ndiffusion-based synthetic samples to enhance prompt learning, providing greater\ninformation for semantic-visual alignment. Extensive experiments on five public\nbenchmarks, including RESISC45 and Flowers102, and across three learning\nparadigms-UL, SSL, and TRZSL-demonstrate that AiR achieves substantial and\nconsistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art unsupervised prompt\nlearning methods.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-04-17.jsonl"}
