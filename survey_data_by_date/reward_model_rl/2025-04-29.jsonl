Brain-inspired\nvision sensors (BVS) have recently gained attention as an alternative, offering\nhigh temporal resolution with reduced bandwidth and power requirements. Here,\nwe present the first quantitative evaluation framework for two representative\nclasses of BVSs in variable-speed robotic sensing, including event-based vision\nsensors (EVS) that detect asynchronous temporal contrasts, and the\nprimitive-based sensor Tianmouc that employs a complementary mechanism to\nencode both spatiotemporal changes and intensity. A unified testing protocol is\nestablished, including crosssensor calibrations, standardized testing\nplatforms, and quality metrics to address differences in data modality. From an\nimaging standpoint, we evaluate the effects of sensor non-idealities, such as\nmotion-induced distortion, on the capture of structural information. For\nfunctional benchmarking, we examine task performance in corner detection and\nmotion estimation under different rotational speeds. Results indicate that EVS\nperforms well in highspeed, sparse scenarios and in modestly fast, complex\nscenes, but exhibits performance limitations in high-speed, cluttered settings\ndue to pixel-level bandwidth variations and event rate saturation. In\ncomparison, Tianmouc demonstrates consistent performance across sparse and\ncomplex scenarios at various speeds, supported by its global, precise,\nhigh-speed spatiotemporal gradient samplings. These findings offer valuable\ninsights into the applicationdependent suitability of BVS technologies and\nsupport further advancement in this area.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["comparison"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["evaluation"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-04-29.jsonl"}

This study\nproposes an accelerated sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm for 3D-3D rigid\nregistration of transthoracic echocardiographic images with significant and\nlimited overlap taken from apical window that is robust to the noise and\nintensity variation in ultrasound images. The algorithm estimates the\ntranslational and rotational components of the rigid transform through an\niterative process and requires an initial approximation of the rotation and\ntranslation limits. We perform registration in two ways: the image-based\nregistration computes the transform to align the end-diastolic frame of the\napical nonstandard image to the apical standard image and applies the same\ntransform to all frames of the cardiac cycle, whereas the mask-based\nregistration approach uses the binary masks of the left ventricle in the same\nway. The SMC and exhaustive search (EX) algorithms were evaluated for 4D\ntemporal sequences recorded from 7 volunteers who participated in a study\nconducted at the Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute. The evaluations\ndemonstrate that the mask-based approach of the accelerated SMC yielded a Dice\nscore value of 0.819 +/- 0.045 for the left ventricle and gained 16.7x speedup\ncompared to the CPU version of the SMC algorithm.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-04-29.jsonl"}
