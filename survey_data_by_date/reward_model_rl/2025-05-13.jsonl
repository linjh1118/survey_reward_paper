The AR property makes Selftok\nfundamentally distinct from traditional spatial tokens in the following two key\nways: - Selftok offers an elegant and minimalist approach to unify diffusion\nand AR for vision-language models (VLMs): By representing images with Selftok\ntokens, we can train a VLM using a purely discrete autoregressive architecture\n-- like that in LLMs -- without requiring additional modules or training\nobjectives. - We theoretically show that the AR prior satisfies the Bellman\nequation, whereas the spatial prior does not.

To this end, we design an\ninnovative Transformer-based Adaptive Cross-modal Fusion Network (TACFN).\nSpecifically, for the redundant features, we make one modality perform\nintra-modal feature selection through a self-attention mechanism, so that the\nselected features can adaptively and efficiently interact with another\nmodality.

Drawing on\nthe inherent human estimating process, the proposed method reframes the landing\ntask as an optimization problem. The UAV employs variations in the visual\ncharacteristics of a specially designed lenticular circle on the landing pad,\nwhere the perceived color and form provide critical information for estimating\nboth altitude and depth. Reinforcement learning algorithms are utilized to\napproximate the functions governing these estimations, enabling the UAV to\nascertain ideal landing settings via training. This method's efficacy is\nassessed by simulations and experiments, showcasing its potential for robust\nand accurate autonomous landing without dependence on complex sensor setups.\nThis research contributes to the advancement of cost-effective and efficient\nUAV landing solutions, paving the way for wider applicability across various\nfields.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["reinforcement learning"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-05-13.jsonl"}

To address this challenge, we propose\n\\textbf{N}oise \\textbf{O}ptimized \\textbf{C}onditional \\textbf{D}iffusion for\n\\textbf{D}omain \\textbf{A}daptation (\\textbf{NOCDDA}), which seamlessly\nintegrates the generative capabilities of conditional diffusion models with the\ndecision-making requirements of DA to achieve task-coupled optimization for\nefficient adaptation. For robust cross-domain consistency, we modify the DA\nclassifier to align with the conditional diffusion classifier within a unified\noptimization framework, enabling forward training on noise-varying cross-domain\nsamples. Furthermore, we argue that the conventional \\( \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0},\n\\mathbf{I}) \\) initialization in diffusion models often generates\nclass-confused hcpl-tds, compromising discriminative DA. To resolve this, we\nintroduce a class-aware noise optimization strategy that refines sampling\nregions for reverse class-specific hcpl-tds generation, effectively enhancing\ncross-domain alignment.
