This enables precise quantification of\nalignment between generated images and compositional prompts. Furthermore, we\npropose an alignment framework that uses CompQuest's feedback as preference\nsignals to improve diffusion models' compositional image generation abilities.\nUsing adjustable per-image preferences, our method is easily scalable and\nflexible for different tasks. Evaluation of 9 T2I models reveals that: (1)\nmodels remarkable struggle more with compositional tasks with more complex\n3D-spatial configurations, and (2) a noticeable performance gap exists between\nopen-source accessible models and closed-source commercial models.

Therefore, we propose DexGarmentLab, the first environment\nspecifically designed for dexterous (especially bimanual) garment manipulation,\nwhich features large-scale high-quality 3D assets for 15 task scenarios, and\nrefines simulation techniques tailored for garment modeling to reduce the\nsim-to-real gap. Previous data collection typically relies on teleoperation or\ntraining expert reinforcement learning (RL) policies, which are labor-intensive\nand inefficient. In this paper, we leverage garment structural correspondence\nto automatically generate a dataset with diverse trajectories using only a\nsingle expert demonstration, significantly reducing manual intervention.\nHowever, even extensive demonstrations cannot cover the infinite states of\ngarments, which necessitates the exploration of new algorithms. To improve\ngeneralization across diverse garment shapes and deformations, we propose a\nHierarchical gArment-manipuLation pOlicy (HALO). It first identifies\ntransferable affordance points to accurately locate the manipulation area, then\ngenerates generalizable trajectories to complete the task. Through extensive\nexperiments and detailed analysis of our method and baseline, we demonstrate\nthat HALO consistently outperforms existing methods, successfully generalizing\nto previously unseen instances even with significant variations in shape and\ndeformation where others fail.

However, these models predominantly rely on pure text as the medium for\nboth expressing and structuring reasoning, even when visual information is\npresent. In this work, we argue that language may not always be the most\nnatural or effective modality for reasoning, particularly in tasks involving\nspatial and geometrical information. Motivated by this, we propose a new\nparadigm, Visual Planning, which enables planning through purely visual\nrepresentations, independent of text. In this paradigm, planning is executed\nvia sequences of images that encode step-by-step inference in the visual\ndomain, akin to how humans sketch or visualize future actions. We introduce a\nnovel reinforcement learning framework, Visual Planning via Reinforcement\nLearning (VPRL), empowered by GRPO for post-training large vision models,\nleading to substantial improvements in planning in a selection of\nrepresentative visual navigation tasks, FrozenLake, Maze, and MiniBehavior. Our\nvisual planning paradigm outperforms all other planning variants that conduct\nreasoning in the text-only space. Our results establish Visual Planning as a\nviable and promising alternative to language-based reasoning, opening new\navenues for tasks that benefit from intuitive, image-based inference.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["reinforcement learning"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-05-19.jsonl"}
