However, due to the\nmisalignment between the pixel-space distortion and human perception, such\nschemes often face the difficulties in achieving both high-realism and\nhigh-fidelity at ultra-low bitrate. To solve this problem, we propose\n\\textbf{G}enerative \\textbf{L}atent \\textbf{C}oding (\\textbf{GLC}) models for\nimage and video compression, termed GLC-image and GLC-Video. The transform\ncoding of GLC is conducted in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized\nvariational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE). Compared to the pixel-space, such a latent\nspace offers greater sparsity, richer semantics and better alignment with human\nperception, and show its advantages in achieving high-realism and high-fidelity\ncompression. To further enhance performance, we improve the hyper prior by\nintroducing a spatial categorical hyper module in GLC-image and a\nspatio-temporal categorical hyper module in GLC-video. Additionally, the\ncode-prediction-based loss function is proposed to enhance the semantic\nconsistency. Experiments demonstrate that our scheme shows high visual quality\nat ultra-low bitrate for both image and video compression.
