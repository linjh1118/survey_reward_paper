To address these\nshortcomings, we introduce a novel multi-modal Co-AttenDWG architecture that\nleverages dual-path encoding, co-attention with dimension-wise gating, and\nadvanced expert fusion. Our approach begins by projecting text and image\nfeatures into a common embedding space, where a dedicated co-attention\nmechanism enables simultaneous, fine-grained interactions between modalities.\nThis mechanism is further enhanced by a dimension-wise gating network that\nadaptively regulates the feature contributions at the channel level, ensuring\nthat only the most relevant information is emphasized. In parallel, dual-path\nencoders refine the representations by processing cross-modal information\nseparately before an additional cross-attention layer further aligns\nmodalities. The refined features are then aggregated via an expert fusion\nmodule that combines learned gating and self-attention to produce a robust,\nunified representation. We validate our approach on the MIMIC and SemEval\nMemotion 1.0, where experimental results demonstrate significant improvements\nin cross-modal alignment and state-of-the-art performance, underscoring the\npotential of our model for a wide range of multi-modal applications.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["fine-grained", "dimension"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-05-27.jsonl"}

This position paper argues that mechanistic interpretability\nshould prioritize feature consistency in SAEs -- the reliable convergence to\nequivalent feature sets across independent runs. We propose using the Pairwise\nDictionary Mean Correlation Coefficient (PW-MCC) as a practical metric to\noperationalize consistency and demonstrate that high levels are achievable\n(0.80 for TopK SAEs on LLM activations) with appropriate architectural choices.\nOur contributions include detailing the benefits of prioritizing consistency;\nproviding theoretical grounding and synthetic validation using a model\norganism, which verifies PW-MCC as a reliable proxy for ground-truth recovery;\nand extending these findings to real-world LLM data, where high feature\nconsistency strongly correlates with the semantic similarity of learned feature\nexplanations. We call for a community-wide shift towards systematically\nmeasuring feature consistency to foster robust cumulative progress in MI.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["pairwise"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["correlation", "consistency", "reliability"], "score": 3}}, "source_file": "2025-05-27.jsonl"}

While many existing defenses focus on known types of attacks, it is\nmore critical to prepare LLMs for unseen attacks that may arise during\ndeployment. To address this, we propose a lifelong safety alignment framework\nthat enables LLMs to continuously adapt to new and evolving jailbreaking\nstrategies. Our framework introduces a competitive setup between two\ncomponents: a Meta-Attacker, trained to actively discover novel jailbreaking\nstrategies, and a Defender, trained to resist them. To effectively warm up the\nMeta-Attacker, we first leverage the GPT-4o API to extract key insights from a\nlarge collection of jailbreak-related research papers. Through iterative\ntraining, the first iteration Meta-Attacker achieves a 73% attack success rate\n(ASR) on RR and a 57% transfer ASR on LAT using only single-turn attacks.\nMeanwhile, the Defender progressively improves its robustness and ultimately\nreduces the Meta-Attacker's success rate to just 7%, enabling safer and more\nreliable deployment of LLMs in open-ended environments.
