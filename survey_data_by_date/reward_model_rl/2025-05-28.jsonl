First, there is a need for hierarchical\npersonalized representations for users. Previous approaches have typically used\nusers' search behavior as a single, overall representation, which proves\ninadequate in more nuanced generative scenarios. Additionally, query prefixes\nare typically short and may contain typos or sensitive information, increasing\nthe likelihood of generating toxic content compared to traditional text\ngeneration tasks. Such toxic content can degrade user experience and lead to\npublic relations issues. Therefore, the second critical challenge is\ndetoxifying QAC systems.\n  To address these two limitations, we propose a novel model (LaD) that\ncaptures personalized information from both long-term and short-term interests,\nincorporating adaptive detoxification. In LaD, personalized information is\ncaptured hierarchically at both coarse-grained and fine-grained levels. This\napproach preserves as much personalized information as possible while enabling\nonline generation within time constraints. To move a futher step, we propose an\nonline training method based on Reject Preference Optimization (RPO). By\nincorporating a special token [Reject] during both the training and inference\nprocesses, the model achieves adaptive detoxification. Consequently, the\ngenerated text presented to users is both non-toxic and relevant to the given\nprefix.

A significant challenge is how to evade unknown and\ndiverse defense mechanisms. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel\nRule-based Preference modeling Guided Red-Teaming (RPG-RT), which iteratively\nemploys LLM to modify prompts to query and leverages feedback from T2I systems\nfor fine-tuning the LLM. RPG-RT treats the feedback from each iteration as a\nprior, enabling the LLM to dynamically adapt to unknown defense mechanisms.\nGiven that the feedback is often labeled and coarse-grained, making it\ndifficult to utilize directly, we further propose rule-based preference\nmodeling, which employs a set of rules to evaluate desired or undesired\nfeedback, facilitating finer-grained control over the LLM's dynamic adaptation\nprocess. Extensive experiments on nineteen T2I systems with varied safety\nmechanisms, three online commercial API services, and T2V models verify the\nsuperiority and practicality of our approach.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["preference"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["safety"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-05-28.jsonl"}

Therefore, understanding citation intent allows for a more nuanced\ninterpretation of scientific impact. In this paper, we adopted a GAN-based\nmethod to classify citation intents. Our results revealed that the proposed\nmethod achieves competitive classification performance, closely matching\nstate-of-the-art results with substantially fewer parameters.
