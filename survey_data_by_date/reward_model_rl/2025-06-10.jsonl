To bridge this gap, the contextual bias of human domain\nstakeholders, who naturally accumulate insights through direct, real-time\nobservation, becomes indispensable. However, translating their nuanced, and\ncontext-rich input into actionable intelligence for autonomous systems remains\nan open challenge. To address this, we propose LUCIFER (Language Understanding\nand Context-Infused Framework for Exploration and Behavior Refinement), a\ndomain-agnostic framework that integrates a hierarchical decision-making\narchitecture with reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs)\ninto a unified system. This architecture mirrors how humans decompose complex\ntasks, enabling a high-level planner to coordinate specialised sub-agents, each\nfocused on distinct objectives and temporally interdependent actions. Unlike\ntraditional applications where LLMs are limited to single role, LUCIFER\nintegrates them in two synergistic roles: as context extractors, structuring\nverbal stakeholder input into domain-aware representations that influence\ndecision-making through an attention space mechanism aligning LLM-derived\ninsights with the agent's learning process, and as zero-shot exploration\nfacilitators guiding the agent's action selection process during exploration.\nWe benchmark various LLMs in both roles and demonstrate that LUCIFER improves\nexploration efficiency and decision quality, outperforming flat,\ngoal-conditioned policies. Our findings show the potential of context-driven\ndecision-making, where autonomous systems leverage human contextual knowledge\nfor operational success.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["reinforcement learning"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["benchmark"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-06-10.jsonl"}

One of the important issues with\nimage-to-image translation models is that they fail miserably when the\ninformation content between two image domains are asymmetric in nature.
