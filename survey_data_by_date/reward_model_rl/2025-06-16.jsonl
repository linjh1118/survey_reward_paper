SAR ship images present challenges including scale\nvariation, object density, and fuzzy target boundary, which are often\noverlooked in existing methods, leading to suboptimal performance. In this\nwork, we propose O2Former, a tailored instance segmentation framework that\nextends Mask2Former by fully leveraging the structural characteristics of SAR\nimagery. We introduce two key components. The first is the Optimized Query\nGenerator(OQG). It enables multi-scale feature interaction by jointly encoding\nshallow positional cues and high-level semantic information. This improves\nquery quality and convergence efficiency. The second component is the\nOrientation-Aware Embedding Module(OAEM). It enhances directional sensitivity\nthrough direction-aware convolution and polar-coordinate encoding. This\neffectively addresses the challenge of uneven target orientations in SAR\nscenes. Together, these modules facilitate precise feature alignment from\nbackbone to decoder and strengthen the model's capacity to capture fine-grained\nstructural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that O2Former outperforms\nstate of the art instance segmentation baselines, validating its effectiveness\nand generalization on SAR ship datasets.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["fine-grained"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-06-16.jsonl"}

To ensure accurate alignment between generated images and geometry,\nwe propose cross-modal attention distillation, where attention maps from the\nimage diffusion branch are injected into a parallel geometry diffusion branch\nduring both training and inference. This multi-task approach achieves\nsynergistic effects, facilitating geometrically robust image synthesis as well\nas well-defined geometry prediction.

While large language models (LLMs) excel in single-session\ndialogues, they struggle to preserve persona fidelity and conversational\ncoherence across extended interactions. Existing methods typically retrieve\npersona information before response generation, which can constrain diversity\nand result in generic outputs. We propose Post Persona Alignment (PPA), a novel\ntwo-stage framework that reverses this process. PPA first generates a general\nresponse based solely on dialogue context, then retrieves relevant persona\nmemories using the response as a query, and finally refines the response to\nalign with the speaker's persona. This post-hoc alignment strategy promotes\nnaturalness and diversity while preserving consistency and personalization.\nExperiments on multi-session LLM-generated dialogue data demonstrate that PPA\nsignificantly outperforms prior approaches in consistency, diversity, and\npersona relevance, offering a more flexible and effective paradigm for\nlong-term personalized dialogue generation.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["consistency", "dialogue"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-06-16.jsonl"}

We introduce a\nmethodological framework that deliberately maintains a frozen large language\nmodel (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training\na linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. This design is fundamental\nto our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains\nits original language representations without adaptation to visual data.\nConsequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the\nLLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model\nto develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our\nexperimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders\n(SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned\nwith the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned\nlanguage feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE\nreconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we\nreveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations\ngradually align with language feature representations, converging in\nmiddle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT\noutputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current\nadapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation\nlearning.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-06-16.jsonl"}
