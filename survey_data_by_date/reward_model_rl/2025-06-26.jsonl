This often results in agents settling into\nlocal optima, thereby weakening their ability for exploration and error action\ncorrection. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach called\nMobile-R1, which employs interactive multi-turn reinforcement learning with\ntask-level rewards for mobile agents.

This strategy is designed to enhance the exploration and error\ncorrection capabilities of Mobile-R1, leading to significant performance\nimprovements.

However, diffusion models often converge to local optima\nthat are locally visually coherent yet globally inconsistent or conditionally\nmisaligned, due to latent space complexity and suboptimal initialization. Prior\nefforts attempted to address this by strengthening guidance signals or\nmanipulating the initial noise distribution. We introduce Controlled Random\nZigzag Sampling (Ctrl-Z Sampling), a novel sampling strategy designed to detect\nand escape such local maxima during conditional generation. The method first\nidentifies potential local maxima using a reward model. Upon detection, it\ninjects noise and reverts to a previous, noisier state to escape the current\noptimization plateau. The reward model then evaluates candidate trajectories,\naccepting only those that offer improvement, while progressively deeper retreat\nenables stronger escapes when nearby alternatives fail. This controlled random\nzigzag process allows dynamic alternation between forward refinement and\nbackward exploration, enhancing both alignment and visual quality in the\ngenerated outputs.

What makes a base language model\nsuitable for reinforcement learning? Gaining deeper insight into this question\nis essential for developing RL-scalable foundation models of the next\ngeneration. In this work, we investigate how mid-training strategies shape RL\ndynamics, focusing on two representative model families: Qwen and Llama. Our\nstudy reveals that (1) high-quality mathematical corpora, such as\nMegaMath-Web-Pro, significantly improve both base model and RL performance,\nwhile existing alternatives (e.g., FineMath-4plus) fail to do so; (2) further\nadding QA-style data, particularly long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning\nexamples, enhances RL outcomes, and instruction data further unlocks this\neffect; (3) while long-CoT improves reasoning depth, it can also induce\nverbosity of model responses and unstability of RL training, underscoring the\nimportance of data formatting; (4) scaling mid-training consistently leads to\nstronger downstream RL performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a\ntwo-stage mid-training strategy, Stable-then-Decay, in which base models are\nfirst trained on 200B tokens with a constant learning rate, followed by 20B\ntokens across three CoT-focused branches with learning rate decay. This yields\nOctoThinker, a family of models demonstrating strong RL compatibility and\nclosing the performance gap with more RL-friendly model families, i.e., Qwen.\nWe hope our work will help shape pre-training strategies for foundation models\nin the RL era.

Although\nthe research community has made impressive progress in addressing the\nchallenges of this complex task, existing methods often generate environments\nthat are only front-facing, lack visual fidelity, exhibit limited scene\nunderstanding, and are typically fine-tuned for either indoor or outdoor\nsettings. In this work, we address these issues and propose DreamAnywhere, a\nmodular system for the fast generation and prototyping of 3D scenes. Our system\nsynthesizes a 360{\\deg} panoramic image from text, decomposes it into\nbackground and objects, constructs a complete 3D representation through hybrid\ninpainting, and lifts object masks to detailed 3D objects that are placed in\nthe virtual environment. DreamAnywhere supports immersive navigation and\nintuitive object-level editing, making it ideal for scene exploration, visual\nmock-ups, and rapid prototyping -- all with minimal manual modeling. These\nfeatures make our system particularly suitable for low-budget movie production,\nenabling quick iteration on scene layout and visual tone without the overhead\nof traditional 3D workflows. Our modular pipeline is highly customizable as it\nallows components to be replaced independently. Compared to current\nstate-of-the-art text and image-based 3D scene generation approaches,\nDreamAnywhere shows significant improvements in coherence in novel view\nsynthesis and achieves competitive image quality, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across diverse and challenging scenarios.

Despite promising results\nwere achieved, most existing methods do not sufficiently explore the scene\nevolution within an event temporal proposal for captioning, and therefore\nperform less satisfactorily when the scenes and objects change over a\nrelatively long proposal. To address this problem, we propose a graph-based\npartition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning within\ntwo stages. For the ``partition\" stage, a whole event proposal is split into\nshort video segments for captioning at a finer level. For the ``summarization\"\nstage, the generated sentences carrying rich description information for each\nsegment are summarized into one sentence to describe the whole event. We\nparticularly focus on the ``summarization\" stage, and propose a framework that\neffectively exploits the relationship between semantic words for summarization.\nWe achieve this goal by treating semantic words as nodes in a graph and\nlearning their interactions by coupling Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and\nLong Short Term Memory (LSTM), with the aid of visual cues. Two schemes of\nGCN-LSTM Interaction (GLI) modules are proposed for seamless integration of GCN\nand LSTM.

These value trade-offs are an\nintegral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools\nfor interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are\nlimited. In cognitive science, so-called \"cognitive models\" provide formal\naccounts of these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a\nspeaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. In\nthis work, we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to interpret the\nextent to which LLMs represent human-like trade-offs. We apply this lens to\nsystematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings:\ndegrees of reasoning \"effort\" in frontier black-box models, and RL\npost-training dynamics of open-source models. Our results highlight patterns of\nhigher informational utility than social utility in reasoning models, and in\nopen-source models shown to be stronger in mathematical reasoning.
