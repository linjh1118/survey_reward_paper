On one hand, regressive\nSR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single\nsolution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity\nin information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On\nthe other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but\nselecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This\npaper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most\ntrustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic\nreasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs\nsuch as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries\nto assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The\ntop-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy\noutput in a cost-effective manner.

In recent studies,\nReinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the\nreasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the\nchallenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain\nlargely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing\nmultimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and\nshortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model\nmisinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut\nproblem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,\ndirectly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.\nTo tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with\na clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This\nglobal context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking\nkey multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the\naccurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a\ncontext reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy\nrewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the\nLLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process\nsuccessfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods.
