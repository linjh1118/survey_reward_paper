Lau"], "title": "Shape-for-Motion: Precise and Consistent Video Editing with 3D Proxy", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent advances in deep generative modeling have unlocked unprecedented\nopportunities for video synthesis. In real-world applications, however, users\noften seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with\nprecise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing\nmethods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open\nand challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel\nframework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video\nediting. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the\ninput video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be\nperformed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To\nsimplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that\nallows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits\nare then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D\nmeshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce\nthe edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a\ndecoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework\nsupports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the\nvideo frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture\nmodification, and object composition. Our approach marks a key step toward\nhigh-quality, controllable video editing workflows. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach.

While Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky.\nCommon issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation\nof overly detailed or \"overthinking\" reasoning. Our work investigates how the\nKL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric\nPolicy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled\nresponses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples,\nDifficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically\nadjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents\npolicy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes\nsamples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative\nsamples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to\npenalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages\nmore concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We\napply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B\nsignificantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7\\% gain over\nthe base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning\nbenchmarks.
