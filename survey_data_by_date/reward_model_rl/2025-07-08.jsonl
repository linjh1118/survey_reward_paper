Recently, vision language\n(VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as\na promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely\nunexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only\none simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn\nfine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and\nvisual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment.\nSecond, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking\nthe intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective\nmodeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a\nnovel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved\nsurvival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors\nto generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region\nlevels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various\nsurvival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features\nvia Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive\nlearning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different\nsurvival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language\nalignment. Furthermore, we introduce two modules, i.e., Cross-Level Propagation\n(CLP) and Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) to maximize hierarchical\ncooperation by promoting interactions and consistency be-tween patch and region\nlevels. Experiments on three TCGA datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["consistency", "fine-grained"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-07-08.jsonl"}

Unlike many existing multi-modal models, which are primarily\nadapted for multi-class classification, CVS recognition requires a multi-label\nframework. Zero-shot evaluation of existing multi-modal surgical models shows a\nsignificant performance gap for this task. To address this, we propose\nCVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained,\nbinary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with\ntextual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts.\nBy adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the\nEndoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the\nResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that\nCVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts,\nboosts CVS recognition over image-only methods. We also propose text-specific\ninference methods, that helps in analysing the image-text alignment. While\nfurther work is needed to match state-of-the-art spatial annotation-based\nmethods, this approach highlights the potential of adapting generalist models\nto specialized surgical tasks.

In this work, we explore\nvision language models (VLMs) and advanced fusion strategies to enhance the\nclassification of crisis data in three different tasks.

Additionally, we leverage\nContrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)-based vision and text embeddings,\nwhich, without task-specific fine-tuning, outperform traditional models.

Our results show that while Differential Attention improves\nclassification performance, Guided CA remains highly effective in aligning\nmultimodal features. Extensive experiments on the CrisisMMD benchmark data set\ndemonstrate that the combination of pretrained VLMs, enriched textual\ndescriptions, and adaptive fusion strategies consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models in classification accuracy, contributing to more\nreliable and interpretable models for three different tasks that are crucial\nfor disaster response.
