Despite its empirical success, the theoretical\nproperties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work,\nwe first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability\nevolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to\ninitialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can\ninadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This\nmisallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising\nboth the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended\npreferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a\ntheoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate\nsupervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference\noptimization. Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to\nexplicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs,\nwhile maintaining stable optimization dynamics. Experiments on challenging\nreasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently\nimproves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with\nintended preferences, outperforming standard DPO.

Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines\nan implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.\nHowever, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,\ncompared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head\nover the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a\ngeneralization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They\ncan be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and\ndiffer only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding\nof the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate\nthe root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,\nis that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,\nthey often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,\nas well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against\nalternative hypotheses for the generalization gap.

However, no\nbenchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this\ngap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a\ndiagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception\nof subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box\nevaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and\nspatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with\ndense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and\nincorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate\noptions, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control,\nTreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the\nmost advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60%\naccuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR\n(Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to\nsupervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning,\nenabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized\nfrom Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and\nTreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded\nreasoning.
