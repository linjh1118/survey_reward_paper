Our\nexperiments prove that directly combining ParPS with the sequential update\nscheme leads to the policy updating baseline drift problem, thereby failing to\nachieve improvement. To solve the conflict between monotonic improvement and\nParPS, we propose the Optimal Marginal Deterministic Policy Gradient (OMDPG)\nalgorithm.

It has been shown that, in comparison to regular\nDNN training, training with stylized images reduces texture biases in image\nclassification and improves robustness with respect to image corruptions. In an\neffort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can\nlikewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we\nperform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those\nrandom areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells. The resulting\nstyle-transferred data is then used to train semantic segmentation DNNs with\nthe objective of reducing their dependence on texture cues while enhancing\ntheir reliance on shape-based features. In our experiments, it turns out that\nin semantic segmentation, style transfer augmentation reduces texture bias and\nstrongly increases robustness with respect to common image corruptions as well\nas adversarial attacks. These observations hold for convolutional neural\nnetworks and transformer architectures on the Cityscapes dataset as well as on\nPASCAL Context, showing the generality of the proposed method.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["comparison"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["dataset"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-07-15.jsonl"}
