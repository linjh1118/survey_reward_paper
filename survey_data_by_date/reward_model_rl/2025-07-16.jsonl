However, existing video\ncaptioning benchmarks and models remain predominantly visual centric,\noverlooking the crucial role of audio in conveying scene dynamics, speaker\nintent, and narrative context. This lack of omni datasets and lightweight,\ncapable models hampers progress in fine grained, multimodal video\nunderstanding. To address these challenges, we introduce UGC-VideoCap, a new\nbenchmark and model framework specifically designed for detailed omnimodal\ncaptioning of short form user-generated videos. Unlike prior datasets,\nUGC-VideoCap emphasizes balanced integration of audio and visual modalities,\nfeaturing 1000 TikTok videos annotated through a structured three stage\nhuman-in-the-loop pipeline covering audio only, visual only, and joint audio\nvisual semantics. The benchmark also includes 4000 carefully crafted QA pairs\nprobing both unimodal and cross modal understanding. Alongside the dataset, we\npropose UGC-VideoCaptioner(3B), a 3B parameter captioning model distilled from\nGemini 2.5 Flash. Using a novel two-stage training strategy supervised fine\ntuning followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our approach\nenables efficient adaptation from limited data while maintaining competitive\nperformance. Together, our benchmark and model offer a high-quality foundation\nand a data-efficient solution for advancing omnimodal video captioning in\nunconstrained real-world UGC settings.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["policy optimization"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["benchmark", "dataset"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-07-16.jsonl"}
