In this work, we investigate if we can use CoTs to\npredict final response misalignment. We evaluate a range of monitoring\napproaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text\nclassifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple\nlinear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all\ntext-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or\nunsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers,\nwhile model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive\nsignal. Second, the probe makes accurate predictions before reasoning\ncompletes, achieving strong performance even when applied to early CoT\nsegments. These findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety\nbenchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety\nmonitoring and early intervention during generation.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["safety"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-07-17.jsonl"}

When labeled data is limited,\ntextual information can provide additional context to enhance visual semantic\nunderstanding. However, research exploring the use of textual data to enhance\nvisual semantic embeddings in 3D medical imaging tasks remains scarce. In this\npaper, we propose a novel text-driven multiplanar visual interaction framework\nfor semi-supervised medical image segmentation (termed Text-SemiSeg), which\nconsists of three main modules: Text-enhanced Multiplanar Representation (TMR),\nCategory-aware Semantic Alignment (CSA), and Dynamic Cognitive Augmentation\n(DCA). Specifically, TMR facilitates text-visual interaction through planar\nmapping, thereby enhancing the category awareness of visual features. CSA\nperforms cross-modal semantic alignment between the text features with\nintroduced learnable variables and the intermediate layer of visual features.\nDCA reduces the distribution discrepancy between labeled and unlabeled data\nthrough their interaction, thus improving the model's robustness. Finally,\nexperiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our model effectively\nenhances visual features with textual information and outperforms other\nmethods.

Accepted to VisionDocs @ ICCV 2025", "summary": "Recent progress has been made in region-aware vision-language modeling,\nparticularly with the emergence of the Describe Anything Model (DAM). DAM is\ncapable of generating detailed descriptions of any specific image areas or\nobjects without the need for additional localized image-text alignment\nsupervision. We hypothesize that such region-level descriptive capability is\nbeneficial for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially in\nchallenging scenarios involving images with dense text. In such settings, the\nfine-grained extraction of textual information is crucial to producing correct\nanswers. Motivated by this, we introduce DAM-QA, a framework with a tailored\nevaluation protocol, developed to investigate and harness the region-aware\ncapabilities from DAM for the text-rich VQA problem that requires reasoning\nover text-based information within images. DAM-QA incorporates a mechanism that\naggregates answers from multiple regional views of image content, enabling more\neffective identification of evidence that may be tied to text-related elements.\nExperiments on six VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently\noutperforms the baseline DAM, with a notable 7+ point gain on DocVQA. DAM-QA\nalso achieves the best overall performance among region-aware models with fewer\nparameters, significantly narrowing the gap with strong generalist VLMs. These\nresults highlight the potential of DAM-like models for text-rich and broader\nVQA tasks when paired with efficient usage and integration strategies.
