However, the adoption and\nprogress of these technologies critically depend on the development of reliable\nand fair models, properly evaluated on public data and open benchmarks, which\nhave so far been unavailable in this domain.\n  To address this gap, we present TalentCLEF 2025, the first evaluation\ncampaign focused on skill and job title intelligence. The lab consists of two\ntasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish,\nGerman, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English.\nBoth corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and\nmanually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor\nmarket data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.\n  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered\nthe evaluation of gender bias.\n  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions. Most\nsystems relied on information retrieval techniques built with multilingual\nencoder-based models fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and several of them\nincorporated large language models for data augmentation or re-ranking. The\nresults show that the training strategies have a larger effect than the size of\nthe model alone.

In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a\ntwo-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both\nconsensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven\n(reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation.
