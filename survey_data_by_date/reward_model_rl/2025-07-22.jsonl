In this paper, we propose a Chinese medical dataset\nnamed ChiMed 2.0, which extends our previous work ChiMed, and covers data\ncollected from Chinese medical online platforms and generated by LLMs. ChiMed\n2.0 contains 204.4M Chinese characters covering both traditional Chinese\nmedicine classics and modern general medical data, where there are 164.8K\ndocuments for pre-training, 351.6K question-answering pairs for supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT), and 41.7K preference data tuples for RLHF. To validate the\neffectiveness of our approach for training a Chinese medical LLM, we conduct\nfurther pre-training, SFT, and RLHF experiments on representative general\ndomain LLMs and evaluate their performance on medical benchmark datasets.

The\napplication to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the\ndiscrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry\nconstraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra\ncontinuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian\nprimitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing\nmemory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a\ndiscretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by\nencoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us\nto link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity\ntransformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the\ncomputational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the\ndiscrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete\nrepresentation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\\eg Eikonal\nloss).

However, existing approaches face two major limitations: First,\nthey rely on paired data from only a few chart types, limiting generalization\nto wide range of chart types. Secondly, they lack targeted pre-training for\nchart-data alignment, which hampers the model's understanding of underlying\ndata. In this paper, we introduce ChartScope, an LVLM optimized for in-depth\nchart comprehension across diverse chart types. We propose an efficient data\ngeneration pipeline that synthesizes paired data for a wide range of chart\ntypes, along with a novel Dual-Path training strategy that enabling the model\nto succinctly capture essential data details while preserving robust reasoning\ncapabilities by incorporating reasoning over the underlying data. Lastly, we\nestablish ChartDQA, a new benchmark for evaluating not only question-answering\nat different levels but also underlying data understanding.

However, generating 3D scenes from a single RGB image remains a\nsignificant challenge, as current approaches often struggle to ensure both\nobject generation quality and scene coherence in multi-object scenarios. To\novercome these limitations, we propose a novel three-stage framework for 3D\nscene generation with explicit geometric representations and high-quality\ntextural details via single image-guided model generation and spatial layout\noptimization. Our method begins with an image instance segmentation and\ninpainting phase, which recovers missing details of occluded objects in the\ninput images, thereby achieving complete generation of foreground 3D assets.\nSubsequently, our approach captures the spatial geometry of reference image by\nconstructing pseudo-stereo viewpoint for camera parameter estimation and scene\ndepth inference, while employing a model selection strategy to ensure optimal\nalignment between the 3D assets generated in the previous step and the input.\nFinally, through model parameterization and minimization of the Chamfer\ndistance between point clouds in 3D and 2D space, our approach optimizes layout\nparameters to produce an explicit 3D scene representation that maintains\nprecise alignment with input guidance image.

The\napplication to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the\ndiscrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry\nconstraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra\ncontinuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian\nprimitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing\nmemory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a\ndiscretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by\nencoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us\nto link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity\ntransformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the\ncomputational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the\ndiscrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete\nrepresentation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\\eg Eikonal\nloss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and\nenforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based\nconsistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher\nrelighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding\ncomplex manually designed optimization. The experiments reveal that our method\noutperforms existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods.
