Unlike existing approaches that\nrely on sophisticated network architectures or complex data imputation\ntechniques, SimMLM provides a generic and effective solution that can adapt to\nvarious missing modality scenarios with improved accuracy and robustness.\nSpecifically, SimMLM consists of a generic Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts\n(DMoME) architecture, featuring a dynamic, learnable gating mechanism that\nautomatically adjusts each modality's contribution in both full and partial\nmodality settings. A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer\n(MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains\nstable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an\nintuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase\naccuracy. We validate SimMLM on multimodal medical image segmentation (BraTS\n2018) and multimodal classification (UPMC Food-101, avMNIST) tasks, where it\nconsistently surpasses competitive methods, demonstrating superior accuracy,\ninterpretability, robustness, and reliability across both complete and missing\nmodality scenarios at test time.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["test time"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["ranking"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["reliability", "accuracy"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-07-28.jsonl"}

In this paper, we aim\nto construct an Earth observation workflow to handle complex queries by\nreasoning about spatial context and user intent. As a reasoning workflow, it\nshould be somewhat autonomous, where predefined ground-truth reasoning paths do\nnot constrain the learning process. Furthermore, its architecture ought to be\nunified yet flexible, enabling the model to perform diverse reasoning tasks\nwith distinct output formats through a single forward pass. Existing remote\nsensing approaches fail to address these requirements, as they rely on\nsupervised fine-tuning paradigms that constrain the autonomy of reasoning. To\nthis end, we propose RemoteReasoner, a flexible and robust workflow for remote\nsensing reasoning tasks. The design of RemoteReasoner integrates a multi-modal\nlarge language model (MLLM) for interpreting user instructions and localizing\ntargets, together with task adaptation strategies that enable multi-granularity\noutput generation. In contrast to existing methods, our framework is trained\nwith reinforcement learning (RL) to endow the MLLM sufficient autonomy for\nprecise reasoning. At the inference stage, our adaptation strategies enable\ndiverse output formats at inference time without requiring task-specific\ndecoders or further fine-tuning.

While existing\nconditional diffusion models incrementally generate motions by conditioning on\npreviously generated characters, they rely on single shared prompts, limiting\nnuanced control and leading to overly simplified interactions. In this paper,\nwe introduce Person-Interaction Noise Optimization (PINO), a novel,\ntraining-free framework designed for generating realistic and customizable\ninteractions among groups of arbitrary size. PINO decomposes complex group\ninteractions into semantically relevant pairwise interactions, and leverages\npretrained two-person interaction diffusion models to incrementally compose\ngroup interactions. To ensure physical plausibility and avoid common artifacts\nsuch as overlapping or penetration between characters, PINO employs\nphysics-based penalties during noise optimization. This approach allows precise\nuser control over character orientation, speed, and spatial relationships\nwithout additional training.

Although these methods are attractive, they hold two major\nlimitations that prevent their use in space applications: they require poses\nduring training, and have high computational cost at training and inference. To\naddress these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2)\na pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3)\nand analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of\nprecise 3D models. A CNN takes a single image as input and outputs a coarse 3D\nmodel represented as an assembly of primitives, along with the target's pose\nrelative to the camera. This assembly of primitives is then used to initialize\n3DGS, significantly reducing the number of training iterations and input images\nneeded -- by at least an order of magnitude. For additional flexibility, the\nCNN component has multiple variants with different pose estimation techniques.\nThis work performs a comparison between these variants, evaluating their\neffectiveness for downstream 3DGS training under noisy or implicit pose\nestimates. The results demonstrate that even with imperfect pose supervision,\nthe pipeline is able to learn high-fidelity 3D representations, opening the\ndoor for the use of novel view synthesis in space applications.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["comparison"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-07-28.jsonl"}
