We propose\nCognitiveAttack, a novel red-teaming framework that systematically leverages\nboth individual and combined cognitive biases. By integrating supervised\nfine-tuning and reinforcement learning, CognitiveAttack generates prompts that\nembed optimized bias combinations, effectively bypassing safety protocols while\nmaintaining high attack success rates. Experimental results reveal significant\nvulnerabilities across 30 diverse LLMs, particularly in open-source models.\nCognitiveAttack achieves a substantially higher attack success rate compared to\nthe SOTA black-box method PAP (60.1% vs. 31.6%), exposing critical limitations\nin current defense mechanisms. These findings highlight multi-bias interactions\nas a powerful yet underexplored attack vector. This work introduces a novel\ninterdisciplinary perspective by bridging cognitive science and LLM safety,\npaving the way for more robust and human-aligned AI systems.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["reinforcement learning"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["safety"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-07-31.jsonl"}

Work in progress", "summary": "Reinforcement learning has proven its effectiveness in enhancing the\nreasoning capabilities of large language models. Recent research efforts have\nprogressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the\ninherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic\ncontent and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable\nperformance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these\nlimitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model\ntrained via a novel multi-stage Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning\n(PCuRL) framework. PCuRL systematically guides the model through tasks of\ngradually increasing difficulty, substantially improving its reasoning\nabilities across diverse multimodal contexts. The framework introduces two key\ninnovations: (1) an online difficulty soft weighting mechanism, dynamically\nadjusting training difficulty across successive RL training stages; and (2) a\ndynamic length reward mechanism, which encourages the model to adaptively\nregulate its reasoning path length according to task complexity, thus balancing\nreasoning efficiency with correctness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate\nthat VL-Cogito consistently matches or surpasses existing reasoning-oriented\nmodels across mainstream multimodal benchmarks spanning mathematics, science,\nlogic, and general understanding, validating the effectiveness of our approach.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["reasoning model"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["reinforcement learning"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-07-31.jsonl"}

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a\nself-supervised method based on bi-level optimization. In the inner loop, we\npretrain a vision encoder only on photographic face images using a set of\nlinearly weighted pretext tasks: classification of categorical exchangeable\nimage file format (EXIF) tags, ranking of ordinal EXIF tags, and detection of\nartificial face manipulations. The outer loop then optimizes the relative\nweights of these pretext tasks to enhance the coarse-grained detection of\nmanipulated faces, serving as a proxy task for identifying AI-generated faces.\nIn doing so, it aligns self-supervised learning more closely with the ultimate\ngoal of AI-generated face detection. Once pretrained, the encoder remains\nfixed, and AI-generated faces are detected either as anomalies under a Gaussian\nmixture model fitted to photographic face features or by a lightweight\ntwo-layer perceptron serving as a binary classifier.
