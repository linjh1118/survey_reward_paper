To mitigate these biases, recent methods employ multiple LLMs as\njudges and aggregate their judgments to select the optimal assessment.

This paper delves into a previously\noverlooked information asymmetry issue in PT, where the visual modality mostly\nconveys more context than the object-oriented textual modality.\nCorrespondingly, coarsely aligning these two modalities could result in the\nbiased attention, driving the model to merely focus on the context area. To\naddress this, we propose DAPT, an effective PT framework based on an intuitive\ndecouple-before-align concept. First, we propose to explicitly decouple the\nvisual modality into the foreground and background representation via\nexploiting coarse-and-fine visual segmenting cues, and then both of these\ndecoupled patterns are aligned with the original foreground texts and the\nhand-crafted background classes, thereby symmetrically strengthening the modal\nalignment. To further enhance the visual concentration, we propose a visual\npull-push regularization tailored for the foreground-background patterns,\ndirecting the original visual representation towards unbiased attention on the\nregion-of-interest object. We demonstrate the power of architecture-free DAPT\nthrough few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and data-efficient\nlearning, all of which yield superior performance across prevailing benchmarks.\nOur code will be released at https://github.com/Ferenas/DAPT.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-08-04.jsonl"}

Existing diffusion-based\nadversarial purification methods often require intensive iterative denoising,\nseverely limiting their practical deployment. In this paper, we propose\nDiffusion Bridge Distillation for Purification (DBLP), a novel and efficient\ndiffusion-based framework for adversarial purification. Central to our approach\nis a new objective, noise bridge distillation, which constructs a principled\nalignment between the adversarial noise distribution and the clean data\ndistribution within a latent consistency model (LCM). To further enhance\nsemantic fidelity, we introduce adaptive semantic enhancement, which fuses\nmulti-scale pyramid edge maps as conditioning input to guide the purification\nprocess. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DBLP\nachieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust accuracy, superior image quality, and\naround 0.2s inference time, marking a significant step toward real-time\nadversarial purification.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["inference time", "scale"], "score": 2}, "reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["consistency", "accuracy"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-08-04.jsonl"}

However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring\nsemantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the\naudio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and\nspatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the\nsemantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded\nspatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful\ninformation can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators\nderived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or\nfrequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the\nfirst framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to\ngenerate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes\nthe generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We\nmeticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing\nspatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts\n(VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between\nthe audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop\nan efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional\nguidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video\ngeneration in a training-free manner.
