However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled\nrepresentations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process\nto obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which\nhinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal\ncontrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent\nrepresentations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the\nCausal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles\nvisual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component\nAnalysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the\nlabeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and\nmitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual\ndisentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal\nalignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent\ncross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through\nfine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a\ncross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations\nthrough mutual interaction.
