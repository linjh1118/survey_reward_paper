To bridge this gap, we introduce GuirlVG, a\nreinforcement learning-based GUI-VG method built on a systematic empirical\nstudy and a novel stabilization technique. We find that naive application of\nRFT underperforms the SFT baseline, motivating a deeper exploration. First, we\ndecompose RFT into its core components and analyze the optimal formulation of\neach. Second, we propose a novel Adversarial KL Factor that dynamically\nstabilizes training to mitigate reward over-optimization. Third, we further\nexplore the training configurations of RFT to enhance effectiveness. Extensive\nexperiments show that GuirlVG, with only 5.2K training samples, outperforms SFT\nmethods trained on over 10M samples, achieving a 7.7% improvement on\nScreenSpot, a 17.2% improvement on ScreenSpotPro, and 91.9% accuracy on\nScreenSpotV2.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["reinforcement learning"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["accuracy"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-08-07.jsonl"}

To further capture the noise-aware\nvisual semantics, ANPrompt computes the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype\n(NRVPP) by averaging the output prompt tokens from the vision encoder. Finally,\nANPrompt introduces alignment, robustness, and anti-noise objectives by\ncomputing a Weak semantic noise Alignment Loss (WALoss) alongside the standard\ncross-entropy and sim loss. Experiments across 11 benchmarks demonstrate that\nANPrompt consistently outperforms existing prompt tuning approaches, achieving\nsuperior robustness to semantic noise and improved generalization to novel\ncategories.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-08-07.jsonl"}

However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software,\nparticularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge,\nwe propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to\nautonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software.\nSpecifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel\nsoftware environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new\nsoftware, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle\nauto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we\ndesign a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a\nCurriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks.\nThe agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of\nadversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist\ntraining strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from\nspecialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA\ncapable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately\nachieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on\ntheir specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across\nfive novel software environments within OS-World.
