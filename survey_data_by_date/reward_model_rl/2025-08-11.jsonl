Despite recent\nadvances, existing VQA models still suffer from two critical limitations:\n\\textit{poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) videos} and\n\\textit{limited explainability}, which restrict their applicability in\nreal-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose\n\\textbf{VQAThinker}, a reasoning-based VQA framework that leverages large\nmultimodal models (LMMs) with reinforcement learning to jointly model video\nquality understanding and scoring, emulating human perceptual decision-making.\nSpecifically, we adopt group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-guided\nreinforcement learning algorithm that enables reasoning over video quality\nunder score-level supervision, and introduce three VQA-specific rewards: (1) a\n\\textbf{bell-shaped regression reward} that increases rapidly as the prediction\nerror decreases and becomes progressively less sensitive near the ground truth;\n(2) a \\textbf{pairwise ranking reward} that guides the model to correctly\ndetermine the relative quality between video pairs; and (3) a \\textbf{temporal\nconsistency reward} that encourages the model to prefer temporally coherent\nvideos over their perturbed counterparts. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat VQAThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and OOD\nVQA benchmarks, showing strong generalization for video quality scoring.\nFurthermore, evaluations on video quality understanding tasks validate its\nsuperiority in distortion attribution and quality description compared to\nexisting explainable VQA models and LMMs. These findings demonstrate that\nreinforcement learning offers an effective pathway toward building\ngeneralizable and explainable VQA models solely with score-level supervision.", "survey_categories": {"reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "policy optimization", "ranking", "pairwise", "alignment"], "score": 5}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["consistency"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-08-11.jsonl"}

To address this gap, we formalize the\nhaptic captioning task and propose HapticLLaMA, a multimodal sensory language\nmodel that interprets vibration signals into descriptions in a given sensory,\nemotional, or associative category. We investigate two types of haptic\ntokenizers, a frequency-based tokenizer and an EnCodec-based tokenizer, that\nconvert haptic signals into sequences of discrete units, enabling their\nintegration with the LLaMA model. HapticLLaMA is trained in two stages: (1)\nsupervised fine-tuning using the LLaMA architecture with LoRA-based adaptation,\nand (2) fine-tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We\nassess HapticLLaMA's captioning performance using both automated n-gram metrics\nand human evaluation.
