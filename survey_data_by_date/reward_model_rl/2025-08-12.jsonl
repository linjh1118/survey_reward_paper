Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the\nsemantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several\ntime slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission\nto acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being\neavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming\nsignals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic\ninformation. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for\nsemantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not\ncommunicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit\npower of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic\ninformation transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power\nto maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of\nthe user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted\ntwin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine\nthe transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot\nwithout the communications between the server and the jammer.

However, despite recent progress, studies\nshow that SLMs often struggle to generalize across datasets, even for trained\nlanguages and tasks, raising concerns about whether they process speech in a\ntext-like manner as intended. A key challenge underlying this limitation is the\nmodality gap between speech and text representations. The high variability in\nspeech embeddings may allow SLMs to achieve strong in-domain performance by\nexploiting unintended speech variations, ultimately hindering generalization.\nTo mitigate this modality gap, we introduce Optimal Transport Regularization\n(OTReg), a method that formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport\nproblem and derives a regularization loss to improve SLM training. In each\ntraining iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between\nspeech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan,\nthen incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to\noptimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with\ntranscript embeddings. OTReg is lightweight, requiring no additional labels or\nlearnable parameters, and integrates seamlessly into existing SLM training\nprocedures.

While existing approaches leverage large-scale\nmultimodal datasets for latent-space alignment to implicitly learn spatial\nrelationships, they overlook the 3D capabilities of MLLMs. However, this\napproach raises two issues: (1) Operating rooms typically lack multiple video\nand audio sensors, making multimodal 3D data difficult to obtain; (2) Training\nsolely on readily available 2D data fails to capture fine-grained details in\ncomplex scenes. To address this gap, we introduce Spatial-ORMLLM, the first\nlarge vision-language model for 3D spatial reasoning in operating rooms using\nonly RGB modality to infer volumetric and semantic cues, enabling downstream\nmedical tasks with detailed and holistic spatial context. Spatial-ORMLLM\nincorporates a Spatial-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block, which integrates 2D\nmodality inputs with rich 3D spatial knowledge extracted by the estimation\nalgorithm and then feeds the combined features into the visual tower. By\nemploying a unified end-to-end MLLM framework, it combines powerful spatial\nfeatures with textual features to deliver robust 3D scene reasoning without any\nadditional expert annotations or sensor inputs. Experiments on multiple\nbenchmark clinical datasets demonstrate that Spatial-ORMLLM achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance and generalizes robustly to previously unseen\nsurgical scenarios and downstream tasks.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["benchmark", "fine-grained"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-08-12.jsonl"}

Current methods, however, often prioritize basic\nvisual consistency, neglecting crucial editing patterns (e.g., shot/reverse\nshot, cutaways) that drive narrative flow for compelling storytelling. This\nyields outputs that may be visually coherent but lack narrative sophistication\nand true cinematic integrity. To bridge this, we introduce Next Shot Generation\n(NSG): synthesizing a subsequent, high-quality shot that critically conforms to\nprofessional editing patterns while upholding rigorous cinematic continuity.\nOur framework, Cut2Next, leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT). It employs\nin-context tuning guided by a novel Hierarchical Multi-Prompting strategy. This\nstrategy uses Relational Prompts to define overall context and inter-shot\nediting styles. Individual Prompts then specify per-shot content and\ncinematographic attributes. Together, these guide Cut2Next to generate\ncinematically appropriate next shots. Architectural innovations, Context-Aware\nCondition Injection (CACI) and Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM), further\nintegrate these diverse signals without introducing new parameters. We\nconstruct RawCuts (large-scale) and CuratedCuts (refined) datasets, both with\nhierarchical prompts, and introduce CutBench for evaluation. Experiments show\nCut2Next excels in visual consistency and text fidelity.

However, current forecasting systems remain heavily reliant on\nmanual expert interpretation, introducing subjectivity and significant\noperational burdens. With the rapid development of AI technologies, the\nend-to-end \"AI weather station\" is gradually emerging as a new trend in\npredicting severe weather events. Three core challenges impede the development\nof end-to-end AI severe weather system: (1) scarcity of severe weather event\nsamples; (2) imperfect alignment between high-dimensional meteorological data\nand textual warnings; (3) existing multimodal language models are unable to\nhandle high-dimensional meteorological data and struggle to fully capture the\ncomplex dependencies across temporal sequences, vertical pressure levels, and\nspatial dimensions.
