For\neach pairwise comparison, a compact neural network learns to adaptively set the\nK-factor and refine win probabilities.

Unlike typical\nknowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a\nsimpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across\ndifferent types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model.

However, existing\nmethods still struggle with region-level color consistency, especially when the\nreference and target images differ in character pose or motion. Instead of\nrelying on external matching annotations between the reference and target, we\npropose to discover semantic correspondences implicitly through internal\nattention mechanisms. In this paper, we present MangaDiT, a powerful model for\nreference-guided line art colorization based on Diffusion Transformers (DiT).\nOur model takes both line art and reference images as conditional inputs and\nintroduces a hierarchical attention mechanism with a dynamic attention\nweighting strategy. This mechanism augments the vanilla attention with an\nadditional context-aware path that leverages pooled spatial features,\neffectively expanding the model's receptive field and enhancing region-level\ncolor alignment.

Like humans, M3-Agent can process real-time visual and\nauditory inputs to build and update its long-term memory. Beyond episodic\nmemory, it also develops semantic memory, enabling it to accumulate world\nknowledge over time. Its memory is organized in an entity-centric, multimodal\nformat, allowing deeper and more consistent understanding of the environment.\nGiven an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn, iterative\nreasoning and retrieves relevant information from memory to accomplish the\ntask. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal\nagents, we develop M3-Bench, a new long-video question answering benchmark.\nM3-Bench comprises 100 newly recorded real-world videos captured from a robot's\nperspective (M3-Bench-robot) and 929 web-sourced videos across diverse\nscenarios (M3-Bench-web). We annotate question-answer pairs designed to test\nkey capabilities essential for agent applications, such as human understanding,\ngeneral knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning. Experimental results\nshow that M3-Agent, trained via reinforcement learning, outperforms the\nstrongest baseline, a prompting agent using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o,\nachieving 6.7%, 7.7%, and 5.3% higher accuracy on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web\nand VideoMME-long, respectively.

However, a key question\nremains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural\nsource of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data?\nIn this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they\ncan complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy\nor multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.\nSecond, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often\ncontains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text\ndescriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds\nand long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image\nalignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale\nsynthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image\ndata to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we\nfine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o.\nIn addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and\nchallenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which\nincreases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and\nImagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and\ngeneration of imaginative content.
