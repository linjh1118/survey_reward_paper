They typically rely on\npre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics\nintegration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes\nor unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts\na 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,\nenabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We\nfirst establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction\nand probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically\nplausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics\nprediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align\nits simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation\nSampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the\ncomplex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the\ntraining, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,\nannotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates\nhigh-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute.

This tendency is reinforced\nby preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction\nbut can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,\nsycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific\nquestion answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,\ndecision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this\nphenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by\nintroducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of\nsycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much\nuser-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates\nadversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading\nresistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to\nmaintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations\nacross open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic\ntendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size.

However, these methods involve a workflow of converting\nvector data into raster images, using image-based generative models, and then\nconverting the results back into vector data. This process is complex and\nredundant, often resulting in information loss. Raster images, unlike vector\ndata, cannot scale without losing detail and precision. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel deep learning framework called DiffPlanner for\nboundary-constrained floor plan generation, which operates entirely in vector\nspace. Our framework is a Transformer-based conditional diffusion model that\nintegrates an alignment mechanism in training, aligning the optimization\ntrajectory of the model with the iterative design processes of designers. This\nenables our model to handle complex vector data, better fit the distribution of\nthe predicted targets, accomplish the challenging task of floor plan layout\ndesign, and achieve user-controllable generation. We conduct quantitative\ncomparisons, qualitative evaluations, ablation experiments, and perceptual\nstudies to evaluate our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nDiffPlanner surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in generating floor\nplans and bubble diagrams in the creative stages, offering more controllability\nto users and producing higher-quality results that closely match the ground\ntruths.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-08-20.jsonl"}

An adversary\ncan inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL\nencoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,\nhowever, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit\nco-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of\ndiscriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),\na DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.\nInspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract\nthe critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into\ndata-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by\nstrategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,\nformulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with\ntheoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet\neffective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,\nwhile maintaining clean-data accuracy.

Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to\nhandle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in\ntemporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained\nsetting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both\nfine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more\ndetailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed\ndataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense\nmodification text that is around seven times more than its existing\ncounterpart.

Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this\nchallenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate\nstructured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,\nhighlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward\nstructured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in\nSFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured\nReinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially\nbreaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,\ncontaining 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate\nsimplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art\nperformance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a\nplateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method\nleverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual\nand visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate\nfine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess\nstructural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an\nevaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training\nstability.
