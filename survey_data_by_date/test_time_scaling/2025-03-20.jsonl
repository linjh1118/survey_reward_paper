In this paper, we introduce ReBot, a\nnovel real-to-sim-to-real approach for scaling real robot datasets and adapting\nVLA models to target domains, which is the last-mile deployment challenge in\nrobot manipulation. Specifically, ReBot replays real-world robot trajectories\nin simulation to diversify manipulated objects (real-to-sim), and integrates\nthe simulated movements with inpainted real-world background to synthesize\nphysically realistic and temporally consistent robot videos (sim-to-real). Our\napproach has several advantages: 1) it enjoys the benefit of real data to\nminimize the sim-to-real gap; 2) it leverages the scalability of simulation;\nand 3) it can generalize a pretrained VLA to a target domain with fully\nautomated data pipelines. Extensive experiments in both simulation and\nreal-world environments show that ReBot significantly enhances the performance\nand robustness of VLAs. For example, in SimplerEnv with the WidowX robot, ReBot\nimproved the in-domain performance of Octo by 7.2% and OpenVLA by 21.8%, and\nout-of-domain generalization by 19.9% and 9.4%, respectively.
