However, the user cannot utilize the model to further their\nknowledge other than the GPS coordinate; the model lacks an understanding of\nthe location and the conversational ability to communicate with the user. In\nrecent days, with tremendous progress of large multimodal models (LMMs)\nproprietary and open-source researchers have attempted to geolocalize images\nvia LMMs. However, the issues remain unaddressed; beyond general tasks, for\nmore specialized downstream tasks, one of which is geolocalization, LMMs\nstruggle. In this work, we propose to solve this problem by introducing a\nconversational model GAEA that can provide information regarding the location\nof an image, as required by a user. No large-scale dataset enabling the\ntraining of such a model exists. Thus we propose a comprehensive dataset GAEA\nwith 800K images and around 1.6M question answer pairs constructed by\nleveraging OpenStreetMap (OSM) attributes and geographical context clues. For\nquantitative evaluation, we propose a diverse benchmark comprising 4K\nimage-text pairs to evaluate conversational capabilities equipped with diverse\nquestion types.
