Instead of scaling up video foundation models\nthrough expensive training costs, we explore the power of Test-Time Scaling\n(TTS) in video generation, aiming to answer the question: if a video generation\nmodel is allowed to use non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much\ncan it improve generation quality given a challenging text prompt. In this\nwork, we reinterpret the test-time scaling of video generation as a searching\nproblem to sample better trajectories from Gaussian noise space to the target\nvideo distribution. Specifically, we build the search space with test-time\nverifiers to provide feedback and heuristic algorithms to guide searching\nprocess. Given a text prompt, we first explore an intuitive linear search\nstrategy by increasing noise candidates at inference time. As full-step\ndenoising all frames simultaneously requires heavy test-time computation costs,\nwe further design a more efficient TTS method for video generation called\nTree-of-Frames (ToF) that adaptively expands and prunes video branches in an\nautoregressive manner.

Under few-shot conditions, CFREID faces\ntwo core challenges: 1) learning knowledge from few-shot data of unseen domain,\nand 2) avoiding catastrophic forgetting of seen domains. To tackle these two\nchallenges, we propose a Stable Distribution Alignment (SDA) framework from\nfeature distribution perspective. Specifically, our SDA is composed of two\nmodules, i.e., Meta Distribution Alignment (MDA) and Prototype-based Few-shot\nAdaptation (PFA). To support the study of CFReID, we establish an evaluation\nbenchmark for CFReID on five publicly available ReID datasets. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our SDA can enhance the few-shot learning and\nanti-forgetting capabilities under few-shot conditions. Notably, our approach,\nusing only 5\\% of the data, i.e., 32 IDs, significantly outperforms LReID's\nstate-of-the-art performance, which requires 700 to 1,000 IDs.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["benchmark", "evaluation"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-03-25.jsonl"}

This work introduces a\ntuning-free approach that repurposes pretrained diffusion-based inpainting\nmodels for amodal segmentation. Our approach is motivated by the\n\"occlusion-free bias\" of inpainting models, i.e., the inpainted objects tend to\nbe complete objects without occlusions. Specifically, we reconstruct the\noccluded regions of an object via inpainting and then apply segmentation, all\nwithout additional training or fine-tuning. Experiments on five datasets\ndemonstrate the generalizability and robustness of our approach.

Many existing\nmetrics focus on a model's producibility, i.e. the quality and breadth of\noutputs it can generate. However, the actual value from using a generative\nmodel stems not just from what it can produce but whether a user with a\nspecific goal can produce an output that satisfies that goal. We refer to this\nproperty as steerability. In this paper, we first introduce a mathematical\nframework for evaluating steerability independently from producibility.\nSteerability is more challenging to evaluate than producibility because it\nrequires knowing a user's goals. We address this issue by creating a benchmark\ntask that relies on one key idea: sample an output from a generative model and\nask users to reproduce it. We implement this benchmark in a large-scale user\nstudy of text-to-image models and large language models. Despite the ability of\nthese models to produce high-quality outputs, they all perform poorly on\nsteerabilty. This suggests that we need to focus on improving the steerability\nof generative models.
