We present\nDita, a scalable framework that leverages Transformer architectures to directly\ndenoise continuous action sequences through a unified multimodal diffusion\nprocess. Departing from prior methods that condition denoising on fused\nembeddings via shallow networks, Dita employs in-context conditioning --\nenabling fine-grained alignment between denoised actions and raw visual tokens\nfrom historical observations. This design explicitly models action deltas and\nenvironmental nuances. By scaling the diffusion action denoiser alongside the\nTransformer's scalability, Dita effectively integrates cross-embodiment\ndatasets across diverse camera perspectives, observation scenes, tasks, and\naction spaces. Such synergy enhances robustness against various variances and\nfacilitates the successful execution of long-horizon tasks. Evaluations across\nextensive benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art or comparative performance in\nsimulation. Notably, Dita achieves robust real-world adaptation to\nenvironmental variances and complex long-horizon tasks through 10-shot\nfinetuning, using only third-person camera inputs. The architecture establishes\na versatile, lightweight and open-source baseline for generalist robot policy\nlearning.

However, existing methods for analyzing 3HGs\nface significant challenges, including the sub-voxel scale of 3HGs at typical\nneuroimaging resolutions, the computational complexity of establishing\ncross-subject correspondences, and the oversimplification of treating 3HGs as\nindependent nodes without considering their community-level relationships. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a fully differentiable subnetwork\npartitioning framework that employs a spectral modularity maximization\noptimization strategy to modularize the organization of 3HGs within GyralNet.\nBy incorporating topological structural similarity and DTI-derived connectivity\npatterns as attribute features, our approach provides a biologically meaningful\nrepresentation of cortical organization. Extensive experiments on the Human\nConnectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate that our method effectively\npartitions GyralNet at the individual level while preserving the\ncommunity-level consistency of 3HGs across subjects, offering a robust\nfoundation for understanding brain connectivity.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["dataset", "consistency"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-03-26.jsonl"}
