This task is especially\nchallenging due to the absence of auditory information and the inherent\nambiguity when visually distinguishing phonemes that have overlapping visemes\nwhere different phonemes appear identical on the lips. Current methods\ntypically attempt to predict words or characters directly from these visual\ncues, but this approach frequently encounters high error rates due to\ncoarticulation effects and viseme ambiguity. We propose a novel two-stage,\nphoneme-centric framework for Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (V-ASR) that\naddresses these longstanding challenges. First, our model predicts a compact\nsequence of phonemes from visual inputs using a Video Transformer with a CTC\nhead, thereby reducing the task complexity and achieving robust speaker\ninvariance. This phoneme output then serves as the input to a fine-tuned Large\nLanguage Model (LLM), which reconstructs coherent words and sentences by\nleveraging broader linguistic context. Unlike existing methods that either\npredict words directly-often faltering on visually similar phonemes-or rely on\nlarge-scale multimodal pre-training, our approach explicitly encodes\nintermediate linguistic structure while remaining highly data efficient. We\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance on two challenging datasets, LRS2 and\nLRS3, where our method achieves significant reductions in Word Error Rate (WER)\nachieving a SOTA WER of 18.7 on LRS3 despite using 99.4% less labelled data\nthan the next best approach.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-03-30.jsonl"}

MAVERIX\nuniquely provides models with audiovisual tasks, closely mimicking the\nmultimodal perceptual experiences available to humans during inference and\ndecision-making processes. To our knowledge, MAVERIX is the first benchmark\naimed explicitly at assessing comprehensive audiovisual integration.\nExperiments with state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 1.5 Pro and o1, show\nperformance approaching human levels (around 70% accuracy), while human experts\nreach near-ceiling performance (95.1%). With standardized evaluation protocols,\na rigorously annotated pipeline, and a public toolkit, MAVERIX establishes a\nchallenging testbed for advancing audiovisual multimodal intelligence.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["o1"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["benchmark", "evaluation", "testbed", "accuracy"], "score": 4}}, "source_file": "2025-03-30.jsonl"}
