Existing methods usually\naggregate multimodal features at a single stage. However, leveraging\nmulti-stage cross-modal features is crucial for detecting objects of various\nscales. Therefore, these methods often struggle to integrate features across\ndifferent scales and modalities effectively, thereby restricting the accuracy\nof detection. Additionally, the time-consuming Query-Key-Value-based\n(QKV-based) cross-attention operations often utilized in existing methods aid\nin reasoning the location and existence of objects by capturing non-local\ncontexts. However, this approach tends to increase computational complexity. To\naddress these challenges, we present SSLFusion, a novel Scale & Space Aligned\nLatent Fusion Model, consisting of a scale-aligned fusion strategy (SAF), a\n3D-to-2D space alignment module (SAM), and a latent cross-modal fusion module\n(LFM). SAF mitigates scale misalignment between modalities by aggregating\nfeatures from both images and point clouds across multiple levels. SAM is\ndesigned to reduce the inter-modal gap between features from images and point\nclouds by incorporating 3D coordinate information into 2D image features.\nAdditionally, LFM captures cross-modal non-local contexts in the latent space\nwithout utilizing the QKV-based attention operations, thus mitigating\ncomputational complexity. Experiments on the KITTI and DENSE datasets\ndemonstrate that our SSLFusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our\napproach obtains an absolute gain of 2.15% in 3D AP, compared with the\nstate-of-art method GraphAlign on the moderate level of the KITTI test set.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["accuracy"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-04-08.jsonl"}
