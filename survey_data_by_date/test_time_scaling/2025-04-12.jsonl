We reaffirm this finding in the modern age of LLM's by\nshowing that in standard RAG pipelines, maximizing for context relevance alone\ncan degrade downstream response quality. In response, we show evaluations of\nexisting RAG methods which account for both context relevance and answer\nquality.

Unlike\nexisting methods that require users to manually decide which data analytics\nmethod to apply, AgentAda automatically identifies the skill needed from a\nlibrary of analytical skills to perform the analysis. This also allows AgentAda\nto use skills that existing LLMs cannot perform out of the box. The library\ncovers a range of methods, including clustering, predictive modeling, and NLP\ntechniques like BERT, which allow AgentAda to handle complex analytics tasks\nbased on what the user needs. AgentAda's dataset-to-insight extraction strategy\nconsists of three key steps: (I) a question generator to generate queries\nrelevant to the user's goal and persona, (II) a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG)-based skill matcher to choose the best data analytics skill\nfrom the skill library, and (III) a code generator that produces executable\ncode based on the retrieved skill's documentation to extract key patterns. We\nalso introduce KaggleBench, a benchmark of curated notebooks across diverse\ndomains, to evaluate AgentAda's performance.
