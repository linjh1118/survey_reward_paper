In this paper, we present a\nnovel perspective on vanilla MoE with top-$k$ routing inspired by sparse\nrepresentation. This allows us to bridge established theoretical insights from\nsparse representation into MoE models. Building on this foundation, we propose\na group sparse regularization approach for the input of top-$k$ routing, termed\nMixture of Group Experts (MoGE). MoGE indirectly regularizes experts by\nimposing structural constraints on the routing inputs, while preserving the\noriginal MoE architecture. Furthermore, we organize the routing input into a 2D\ntopographic map, spatially grouping neighboring elements. This structure\nenables MoGE to capture representations invariant to minor transformations,\nthereby significantly enhancing expert diversity and specialization.\nComprehensive evaluations across various Transformer models for image\nclassification and language modeling tasks demonstrate that MoGE substantially\noutperforms its MoE counterpart, with minimal additional memory and computation\noverhead. Our approach provides a simple yet effective solution to scale the\nnumber of experts and reduce redundancy among them.

In this paper, we introduce OctGPT, a novel\nmultiscale autoregressive model for 3D shape generation that dramatically\nimproves the efficiency and performance of prior 3D autoregressive approaches,\nwhile rivaling or surpassing state-of-the-art diffusion models. Our method\nemploys a serialized octree representation to efficiently capture the\nhierarchical and spatial structures of 3D shapes. Coarse geometry is encoded\nvia octree structures, while fine-grained details are represented by binary\ntokens generated using a vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQVAE),\ntransforming 3D shapes into compact \\emph{multiscale binary sequences} suitable\nfor autoregressive prediction. To address the computational challenges of\nhandling long sequences, we incorporate octree-based transformers enhanced with\n3D rotary positional encodings, scale-specific embeddings, and token-parallel\ngeneration schemes. These innovations reduce training time by 13 folds and\ngeneration time by 69 folds, enabling the efficient training of high-resolution\n3D shapes, e.g.,$1024^3$, on just four NVIDIA 4090 GPUs only within days.\nOctGPT showcases exceptional versatility across various tasks, including text-,\nsketch-, and image-conditioned generation, as well as scene-level synthesis\ninvolving multiple objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OctGPT\naccelerates convergence and improves generation quality over prior\nautoregressive methods, offering a new paradigm for high-quality, scalable 3D\ncontent creation.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["fine-grained"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-04-15.jsonl"}

However, the presence of poor quality fundus images caused by factors\nsuch as inadequate illumination, noise, blurring and other motion artifacts\nyields a significant challenge for accurate DR screening. In this study, we\npropose progressive transfer learning for multi pass restoration to iteratively\nenhance the quality of degraded fundus images, ensuring more reliable DR\nscreening. Unlike previous methods that often focus on a single pass\nrestoration, multi pass restoration via PTL can achieve a superior blind\nrestoration performance that can even improve most of the good quality fundus\nimages in the dataset. Initially, a Cycle GAN model is trained to restore low\nquality images, followed by PTL induced restoration passes over the latest\nrestored outputs to improve overall quality in each pass. The proposed method\ncan learn blind restoration without requiring any paired data while surpassing\nits limitations by leveraging progressive learning and fine tuning strategies\nto minimize distortions and preserve critical retinal features. To evaluate\nPTL's effectiveness on multi pass restoration, we conducted experiments on\nDeepDRiD, a large scale fundus imaging dataset specifically curated for\ndiabetic retinopathy detection.

Even for trained human\noperators, accurate and reliable characterization remains challenging when\nexamining newly discovered materials such as two-dimensional (2D) structures.\nThis bottleneck drives demand for fully autonomous experimentation systems\ncapable of comprehending research objectives without requiring large training\ndatasets. In this work, we present ATOMIC (Autonomous Technology for Optical\nMicroscopy & Intelligent Characterization), an end-to-end framework that\nintegrates foundation models to enable fully autonomous, zero-shot\ncharacterization of 2D materials. Our system integrates the vision foundation\nmodel (i.e., Segment Anything Model), large language models (i.e., ChatGPT),\nunsupervised clustering, and topological analysis to automate microscope\ncontrol, sample scanning, image segmentation, and intelligent analysis through\nprompt engineering, eliminating the need for additional training. When\nanalyzing typical MoS2 samples, our approach achieves 99.7% segmentation\naccuracy for single layer identification, which is equivalent to that of human\nexperts. In addition, the integrated model is able to detect grain boundary\nslits that are challenging to identify with human eyes. Furthermore, the system\nretains robust accuracy despite variable conditions including defocus, color\ntemperature fluctuations, and exposure variations.
