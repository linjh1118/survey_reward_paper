This study introduces a benchmark (n = 4,000 items) designed to\nquantify model-internal reasoning in different domains. We achieve this by\nhaving LLMs indicate the correct solution to reasoning problems not through\ndescriptive text, but by selecting a specific language of their initial\nresponse token that is different from English, the benchmark language.

In this work,\nwe introduce a novel paradigm for animating realistic hand-face interactions.\nOur approach simultaneously learns spatio-temporal contact dynamics and\nbiomechanically plausible deformation effects, enabling natural interactions\nwhere hand movements induce anatomically accurate facial deformations while\nmaintaining collision-free contact. To facilitate this research, we present\nInterHF, a large-scale hand-face interaction dataset featuring 18 interaction\npatterns and 90,000 annotated videos. Additionally, we propose InterAnimate, a\nregion-aware diffusion model designed specifically for interaction animation.\nInterAnimate leverages learnable spatial and temporal latents to effectively\ncapture dynamic interaction priors and integrates a region-aware interaction\nmechanism that injects these priors into the denoising process. To the best of\nour knowledge, this work represents the first large-scale effort to\nsystematically study human hand-face interactions. Qualitative and quantitative\nresults show InterAnimate produces highly realistic animations, setting a new\nbenchmark.

Nevertheless, its full potential remains\nlargely untapped due to the absence of large-scale, 3DGS-specific affordance\ndatasets. To overcome these limitations, we present 3DAffordSplat, the first\nlarge-scale, multi-modal dataset tailored for 3DGS-based affordance reasoning.\nThis dataset includes 23,677 Gaussian instances, 8,354 point cloud instances,\nand 6,631 manually annotated affordance labels, encompassing 21 object\ncategories and 18 affordance types. Building upon this dataset, we introduce\nAffordSplatNet, a novel model specifically designed for affordance reasoning\nusing 3DGS representations. AffordSplatNet features an innovative cross-modal\nstructure alignment module that exploits structural consistency priors to align\n3D point cloud and 3DGS representations, resulting in enhanced affordance\nrecognition accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the 3DAffordSplat\ndataset significantly advances affordance learning within the 3DGS domain,\nwhile AffordSplatNet consistently outperforms existing methods across both seen\nand unseen settings, highlighting its robust generalization capabilities.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["dataset", "consistency", "accuracy", "fine-grained"], "score": 4}}, "source_file": "2025-04-16.jsonl"}
