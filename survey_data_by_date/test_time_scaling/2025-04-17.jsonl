To bridge this gap, we\npropose ReTool, which enhances long-form reasoning with tool-integrated\nlearning, including two key features: (1) dynamic interleaving of real-time\ncode execution within natural language reasoning processes, and (2) an\nautomated RL paradigm that allows policy rollouts with multi-turn real-time\ncode execution and teaches the model in learning when and how to invoke tools\nbased on outcome feedback.

However, despite significant progress,\ntheir outputs may still exhibit issues such as amplified noise, incorrect white\nbalance, or unnatural enhancements when deployed in real world applications. A\nkey challenge is the lack of diverse, large scale training data that captures\nthe complexities of low-light conditions and imaging pipelines. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel image signal processing (ISP) driven data synthesis pipeline\nthat addresses these challenges by generating unlimited paired training data.\nSpecifically, our pipeline begins with easily collected high-quality\nnormal-light images, which are first unprocessed into the RAW format using a\nreverse ISP. We then synthesize low-light degradations directly in the RAW\ndomain. The resulting data is subsequently processed through a series of ISP\nstages, including white balance adjustment, color space conversion, tone\nmapping, and gamma correction, with controlled variations introduced at each\nstage. This broadens the degradation space and enhances the diversity of the\ntraining data, enabling the generated data to capture a wide range of\ndegradations and the complexities inherent in the ISP pipeline. To demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our synthetic pipeline, we conduct extensive experiments\nusing a vanilla UNet model consisting solely of convolutional layers, group\nnormalization, GeLU activation, and convolutional block attention modules\n(CBAMs). Extensive testing across multiple datasets reveals that the vanilla\nUNet model trained with our data synthesis pipeline delivers high fidelity,\nvisually appealing enhancement results, surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nmethods both quantitatively and qualitatively.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-04-17.jsonl"}

As 3D ground truth data is\nhard to come by at scale, previous methods have sought to learn from abundant\n2D videos in a self-supervised manner. Typically, this involves the use of\ndifferentiable mesh rendering, which is effective but faces limitations. To\nimprove on this, we propose SHeaP (Self-supervised Head Geometry Predictor\nLearned via 2D Gaussians). Given a source image, we predict a 3DMM mesh and a\nset of Gaussians that are rigged to this mesh. We then reanimate this rigged\nhead avatar to match a target frame, and backpropagate photometric losses to\nboth the 3DMM and Gaussian prediction networks. We find that using Gaussians\nfor rendering substantially improves the effectiveness of this self-supervised\napproach.

Current endeavors\nfor determining the usage of datasets mainly focus on single-modal dataset\nownership verification through intrusive methods and non-intrusive techniques,\nwhile cross-modal approaches remain under-explored. Intrusive methods can adapt\nto multimodal datasets but degrade model accuracy, while non-intrusive methods\nrely on label-driven decision boundaries that fail to guarantee stable\nbehaviors for verification. To address these issues, we propose a novel\nprompt-adapted transferable fingerprinting scheme from a training-free\nperspective, called PATFinger, which incorporates the global optimal\nperturbation (GOP) and the adaptive prompts to capture dataset-specific\ndistribution characteristics. Our scheme utilizes inherent dataset attributes\nas fingerprints instead of compelling the model to learn triggers. The GOP is\nderived from the sample distribution to maximize embedding drifts between\ndifferent modalities. Subsequently, our PATFinger re-aligns the adaptive prompt\nwith GOP samples to capture the cross-modal interactions on the carefully\ncrafted surrogate model. This allows the dataset owner to check the usage of\ndatasets by observing specific prediction behaviors linked to the PATFinger\nduring retrieval queries.
