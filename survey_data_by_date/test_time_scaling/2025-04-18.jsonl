Recent\nadvances in large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to rethink how\nurban causal analysis is conducted. This Perspective examines current urban\ncausal research by analyzing taxonomies that categorize research topics, data\nsources, and methodological approaches to identify structural gaps. We then\nintroduce an LLM-driven conceptual framework, AutoUrbanCI, composed of four\ndistinct modular agents responsible for hypothesis generation, data\nengineering, experiment design and execution, and results interpretation with\npolicy recommendations. We propose evaluation criteria for rigor and\ntransparency and reflect on implications for human-AI collaboration, equity,\nand accountability. We call for a new research agenda that embraces\nAI-augmented workflows not as replacements for human expertise but as tools to\nbroaden participation, improve reproducibility, and unlock more inclusive forms\nof urban causal reasoning.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scaling"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["evaluation", "criteria"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-04-18.jsonl"}

Unlike methods\nbased on pixel-level features or static textual descriptions, PCBEAR leverages\nhuman skeleton poses, which focus solely on body movements, providing robust\nand interpretable explanations of motion dynamics. We define two types of\npose-based concepts: static pose concepts for spatial configurations at\nindividual frames, and dynamic pose concepts for motion patterns across\nmultiple frames. To construct these concepts, PCBEAR applies clustering to\nvideo pose sequences, allowing for automatic discovery of meaningful concepts\nwithout manual annotation. We validate PCBEAR on KTH, Penn-Action, and HAA500,\nshowing that it achieves high classification performance while offering\ninterpretable, motion-driven explanations.

However, for industrial anomaly detection, the scarcity\nof real defect samples poses a critical challenge in leveraging these models.\nWhile 2D anomaly generation has significantly advanced with established\ngenerative models, the adoption of 3D sensors in industrial manufacturing has\nmade leveraging 3D data for surface quality inspection an emerging trend. In\ncontrast to 2D techniques, 3D anomaly generation remains largely unexplored,\nlimiting the potential of 3D data in industrial quality inspection. To address\nthis gap, we propose a novel yet simple 3D anomaly generation method, 3D-PNAS,\nbased on Perlin noise and surface parameterization. Our method generates\nrealistic 3D surface anomalies by projecting the point cloud onto a 2D plane,\nsampling multi-scale noise values from a Perlin noise field, and perturbing the\npoint cloud along its normal direction. Through comprehensive visualization\nexperiments, we demonstrate how key parameters - including noise scale,\nperturbation strength, and octaves, provide fine-grained control over the\ngenerated anomalies, enabling the creation of diverse defect patterns from\npronounced deformations to subtle surface variations. Additionally, our\ncross-category experiments show that the method produces consistent yet\ngeometrically plausible anomalies across different object types, adapting to\ntheir specific surface characteristics. We also provide a comprehensive\ncodebase and visualization toolkit to facilitate future research.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["fine-grained"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-04-18.jsonl"}

While prior research combining visual and tactile\n(visuotactile) information has shown promise, these approaches often struggle\nwith generalization due to the limited availability of visuotactile data. In\nthis paper, we introduce ViTa-Zero, a zero-shot visuotactile pose estimation\nframework. Our key innovation lies in leveraging a visual model as its backbone\nand performing feasibility checking and test-time optimization based on\nphysical constraints derived from tactile and proprioceptive observations.\nSpecifically, we model the gripper-object interaction as a spring-mass system,\nwhere tactile sensors induce attractive forces, and proprioception generates\nrepulsive forces. We validate our framework through experiments on a real-world\nrobot setup, demonstrating its effectiveness across representative visual\nbackbones and manipulation scenarios, including grasping, object picking, and\nbimanual handover. Compared to the visual models, our approach overcomes some\ndrastic failure modes while tracking the in-hand object pose. In our\nexperiments, our approach shows an average increase of 55% in AUC of ADD-S and\n60% in ADD, along with an 80% lower position error compared to FoundationPose.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["test-time"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-04-18.jsonl"}
