This concept has emerged as a promising direction for establishing\ngeneral-purpose machine-learning models in recent preliminary works, e.g., for\nvisual representation learning. In this paper, we present CheXWorld, the first\neffort towards a self-supervised world model for radiographic images.\nSpecifically, our work develops a unified framework that simultaneously models\nthree aspects of medical knowledge essential for qualified radiologists,\nincluding 1) local anatomical structures describing the fine-grained\ncharacteristics of local tissues (e.g., architectures, shapes, and textures);\n2) global anatomical layouts describing the global organization of the human\nbody (e.g., layouts of organs and skeletons); and 3) domain variations that\nencourage CheXWorld to model the transitions across different appearance\ndomains of radiographs (e.g., varying clarity, contrast, and exposure caused by\ncollecting radiographs from different hospitals, devices, or patients).\nEmpirically, we design tailored qualitative and quantitative analyses,\nrevealing that CheXWorld successfully captures these three dimensions of\nmedical knowledge. Furthermore, transfer learning experiments across eight\nmedical image classification and segmentation benchmarks showcase that\nCheXWorld significantly outperforms existing SSL methods and large-scale\nmedical foundation models.

An INR\nrepresents a CT image as a small-scale neural network that takes spatial\ncoordinates as inputs and outputs attenuation values. Fitting an INR to\nsinogram data is similar to classical model-based iterative reconstruction\nmethods. However, training INRs with losses and gradient-based algorithms can\nbe prohibitively slow, taking many thousands of iterations to converge. This\npaper investigates strategies to accelerate the optimization of INRs for CT\nreconstruction. In particular, we propose two approaches: (1) using a modified\nloss function with improved conditioning, and (2) an algorithm based on the\nalternating direction method of multipliers. We illustrate that both of these\napproaches significantly accelerate INR-based reconstruction of a synthetic\nbreast CT phantom in a sparse-view setting.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-04-21.jsonl"}

However, existing methods struggle\nwith challenges such as multi-scale vessel variability, complex curvatures, and\nambiguous boundaries. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),\nTransformer-based models and Mamba-based architectures have advanced the field,\nthey often suffer from vascular discontinuities or edge feature ambiguity. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid framework that\nsynergistically integrates CNNs and Mamba for high-precision retinal vessel\nsegmentation. Our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) The proposed\nHigh-Resolution Edge Fuse Network is a high-resolution preserving hybrid\nsegmentation framework that combines a multi-scale backbone with the\nMulti-scale Retina Edge Fusion (MREF) module to enhance edge features, ensuring\naccurate and robust vessel segmentation. 2) The Dynamic Snake Visual State\nSpace block combines Dynamic Snake Convolution with Mamba to adaptively capture\nvessel curvature details and long-range dependencies. An improved\neight-directional 2D Snake-Selective Scan mechanism and a dynamic weighting\nstrategy enhance the perception of complex vascular topologies. 3) The MREF\nmodule enhances boundary precision through multi-scale edge feature\naggregation, suppressing noise while emphasizing critical vessel structures\nacross scales. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in maintaining vascular\ncontinuity and effectively segmenting vessels in low-contrast regions. This\nwork provides a robust method for clinical applications requiring accurate\nretinal vessel analysis.
