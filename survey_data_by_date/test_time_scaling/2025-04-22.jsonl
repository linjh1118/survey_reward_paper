While diffusion transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated\nremarkable capabilities in high-quality video generation, scaling them to 2K\nresolution remains computationally prohibitive due to quadratic growth in\nmemory and processing costs. In this work, we propose Turbo2K, an efficient and\npractical framework for generating detail-rich 2K videos while significantly\nimproving training and inference efficiency. First, Turbo2K operates in a\nhighly compressed latent space, reducing computational complexity and memory\nfootprint, making high-resolution video synthesis feasible. However, the high\ncompression ratio of the VAE and limited model size impose constraints on\ngenerative quality. To mitigate this, we introduce a knowledge distillation\nstrategy that enables a smaller student model to inherit the generative\ncapacity of a larger, more powerful teacher model. Our analysis reveals that,\ndespite differences in latent spaces and architectures, DiTs exhibit structural\nsimilarities in their internal representations, facilitating effective\nknowledge transfer. Second, we design a hierarchical two-stage synthesis\nframework that first generates multi-level feature at lower resolutions before\nguiding high-resolution video generation. This approach ensures structural\ncoherence and fine-grained detail refinement while eliminating redundant\nencoding-decoding overhead, further enhancing computational efficiency.Turbo2K\nachieves state-of-the-art efficiency, generating 5-second, 24fps, 2K videos\nwith significantly reduced computational cost.

To address\nthis issue, we propose a fully Bayesian Topics over Time (BToT) model via the\nintroduction of a conjugate prior to the Beta distribution. This prior acts as\na regularization that prevents the online version of the algorithm from\nunstable updates when a topic is poorly represented in a mini-batch.
