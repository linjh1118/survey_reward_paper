In this paper, we\nintroduce Self-Play Critic (SPC), a novel approach where a critic model evolves\nits ability to assess reasoning steps through adversarial self-play games,\neliminating the need for manual step-level annotation. SPC involves fine-tuning\ntwo copies of a base model to play two roles, namely a \"sneaky generator\" that\ndeliberately produces erroneous steps designed to be difficult to detect, and a\n\"critic\" that analyzes the correctness of reasoning steps. These two models\nengage in an adversarial game in which the generator aims to fool the critic,\nwhile the critic model seeks to identify the generator's errors. Using\nreinforcement learning based on the game outcomes, the models iteratively\nimprove; the winner of each confrontation receives a positive reward and the\nloser receives a negative reward, driving continuous self-evolution.\nExperiments on three reasoning process benchmarks (ProcessBench, PRM800K,\nDeltaBench) demonstrate that our SPC progressively enhances its error detection\ncapabilities (e.g., accuracy increases from 70.8% to 77.7% on ProcessBench) and\nsurpasses strong baselines, including distilled R1 model.

This work\nproposes an efficient pipeline capable of synthesizing contact-rich,\npenetration-free, and physically plausible grasps for any grasp type, object,\nand articulated hand. Starting from a single human-annotated template for each\nhand and grasp type, our pipeline tackles the complicated synthesis problem\nwith two stages: optimize the object to fit the hand template first, and then\nlocally refine the hand to fit the object in simulation. To validate the\nsynthesized grasps, we introduce a contact-aware control strategy that allows\nthe hand to apply the appropriate force at each contact point to the object.\nThose validated grasps can also be used as new grasp templates to facilitate\nfuture synthesis. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms\nprevious type-unaware grasp synthesis baselines in simulation. Using our\nalgorithm, we construct a dataset containing 10.7k objects and 9.5M grasps,\ncovering 31 grasp types in the GRASP taxonomy. Finally, we train a\ntype-conditional generative model that successfully performs the desired grasp\ntype from single-view object point clouds, achieving an 82.3% success rate in\nreal-world experiments.

Objective: To develop and evaluate a\ndynamic cardiovascular holographic visualization tool for preoperative CABG\nplanning. Methods: Using 4D cardiac computed tomography angiography data from\n14 CABG candidates, we developed a semi-automated workflow for time-resolved\nsegmentation of cardiac structures, epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), and\ncoronary arteries with calcium scoring. The workflow incorporated methods for\ncardiac segmentation, coronary calcification quantification, visualization of\ncoronary depth within EAT, and pericardial adhesion assessment through motion\nanalysis. Dynamic cardiovascular holograms were displayed using the Looking\nGlass platform. Thirteen cardiac surgeons evaluated the tool using a Likert\nscale. Additionally, pericardial adhesion scores from holograms of 21 patients\n(including seven undergoing secondary cardiac surgeries) were compared with\nintraoperative findings. Results: Surgeons rated the visualization tool highly\nfor preoperative planning utility (mean Likert score: 4.57/5.0). Hologram-based\npericardial adhesion scoring strongly correlated with intraoperative findings\n(r=0.786, P<0.001).
