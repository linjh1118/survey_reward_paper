Previous small object detection methods\noften focused on improving isolated stages of the pipeline, thereby neglecting\nholistic optimization and consequently constraining overall performance gains.\nTo address this issue, we have optimized three key aspects, namely Purifying,\nLabeling, and Utilizing, in this pipeline, proposing a high-quality Small\nobject detection framework termed PLUSNet. Specifically, PLUSNet comprises\nthree sequential components: the Hierarchical Feature Purifier (HFP) for\npurifying upstream features, the Multiple Criteria Label Assignment (MCLA) for\nimproving the quality of midstream training samples, and the Frequency\nDecoupled Head (FDHead) for more effectively exploiting information to\naccomplish downstream tasks. The proposed PLUS modules are readily integrable\ninto various object detectors, thus enhancing their detection capabilities in\nmulti-scale scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed PLUSNet\nconsistently achieves significant and consistent improvements across multiple\ndatasets for small object detection.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["criteria"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-04-30.jsonl"}

While polygonal building outline extraction\nhas been extensively studied, the unique characteristics of roads, such as\nbranching structures and topological connectivity, pose challenges to these\nmethods. To address this gap, we introduce LDPoly, the first dedicated\nframework for extracting polygonal road outlines from high-resolution aerial\nimages. Our method leverages a novel Dual-Latent Diffusion Model with a\nChannel-Embedded Fusion Module, enabling the model to simultaneously generate\nroad masks and vertex heatmaps. A tailored polygonization method is then\napplied to obtain accurate vectorized road polygons with minimal vertex\nredundancy. We evaluate LDPoly on a new benchmark dataset, Map2ImLas, which\ncontains detailed polygonal annotations for various topographic objects in\nseveral Dutch regions.

A\nfundamental challenge in CRSs lies in effectively understanding user\npreferences from conversations.

While interaction with users can clarify\ntheir true preferences, frequent user involvement can lead to a degraded user\nexperience.\n  To address this problem, we propose a generative reward model based simulated\nuser, named GRSU, for automatic interaction with CRSs. The simulated user\nprovides feedback to the items recommended by CRSs, enabling them to better\ncapture intricate user preferences through multi-turn interaction. Inspired by\ngenerative reward models, we design two types of feedback actions for the\nsimulated user: i.e., generative item scoring, which offers coarse-grained\nfeedback, and attribute-based item critique, which provides fine-grained\nfeedback. To ensure seamless integration, these feedback actions are unified\ninto an instruction-based format, allowing the development of a unified\nsimulated user via instruction tuning on synthesized data.
