Our empirical analysis reveals that the benefit\nof using Long-CoT varies across problems: while some problems require elaborate\nreasoning, others show no improvement, or even degraded accuracy. This\nmotivates adaptive reasoning strategies that tailor reasoning depth to the\ninput. However, prior work primarily reduces redundancy within long reasoning\npaths, limiting exploration of more efficient strategies beyond the Long-CoT\nparadigm. To address this, we propose a novel two-stage framework for adaptive\nand efficient reasoning. First, we construct a hybrid reasoning model by\nmerging long and short CoT models to enable diverse reasoning styles.
