However, human motions commonly occur within diverse 3D scenes,\nwhich has prompted exploration into scene-aware text-to-motion generation\nmethods. Yet, existing scene-aware methods often rely on large-scale\nground-truth motion sequences in diverse 3D scenes, which poses practical\nchallenges due to the expensive cost. To mitigate this challenge, we are the\nfirst to propose a \\textbf{T}raining-free \\textbf{S}cene-aware\n\\textbf{T}ext-to-\\textbf{Motion} framework, dubbed as \\textbf{TSTMotion}, that\nefficiently empowers pre-trained blank-background motion generators with the\nscene-aware capability. Specifically, conditioned on the given 3D scene and\ntext description, we adopt foundation models together to reason, predict and\nvalidate a scene-aware motion guidance.

While recent state space\nmodels like Mamba show potential for long-range dependency modeling, their\nunfolding operations and fixed scan paths on 1D sequences fail to adapt to\nlocal object semantics and global relation modeling, limiting their efficacy in\ncomplex underwater environments. To address this, we enhance conventional Mamba\nwith the sorting-based scanning mechanism that dynamically reorders scanning\nsequences based on statistical distribution of spatial correlation of all\npixels. In this way, it encourages the network to prioritize the most\ninformative components--structural and semantic features. Upon building this\nmechanism, we devise a Visually Self-adaptive State Block (VSSB) that\nharmonizes dynamic sorting of Mamba with input-dependent dynamic convolution,\nenabling coherent integration of global context and local relational cues. This\nexquisite design helps eliminate global focus bias, especially for widely\ndistributed contents, which greatly weakens the statistical frequency. For\nrobust feature extraction and refinement, we design a cross-feature bridge\n(CFB) to adaptively fuse multi-scale representations. These efforts compose the\nnovel relation-driven Mamba framework for effective UIE (RD-UIE). Extensive\nexperiments on underwater enhancement benchmarks demonstrate RD-UIE outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art approach WMamba in both quantitative metrics and visual\nfidelity, averagely achieving 0.55 dB performance gain on the three benchmarks.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/kkoucy/RD-UIE/tree/main", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["correlation"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-05-05.jsonl"}

Therefore, effective solutions should consider both the quantity and\nquality of data.

In this paper, we propose FreeInsert, a novel framework that\nleverages foundation models including MLLMs, LGMs, and diffusion models to\ndisentangle object generation from spatial placement. This enables unsupervised\nand flexible object insertion in 3D scenes without spatial priors. FreeInsert\nstarts with an MLLM-based parser that extracts structured semantics, including\nobject types, spatial relationships, and attachment regions, from user\ninstructions. These semantics guide both the reconstruction of the inserted\nobject for 3D consistency and the learning of its degrees of freedom. We\nleverage the spatial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to initialize object pose\nand scale. A hierarchical, spatially aware refinement stage further integrates\nspatial semantics and MLLM-inferred priors to enhance placement. Finally, the\nappearance of the object is improved using the inserted-object image to enhance\nvisual fidelity.
