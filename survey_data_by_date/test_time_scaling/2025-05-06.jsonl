Adversaries can exploit this knowledge\nthrough multimodal prompts to extract sensitive details. Evaluating how\neffectively MLLMs can forget such information (targeted unlearning)\nnecessitates the creation of high-quality, well-annotated image-text pairs.\nWhile prior work on unlearning has focused on text, multimodal unlearning\nremains underexplored. To address this gap, we first introduce a multimodal\nunlearning benchmark, UnLOK-VQA (Unlearning Outside Knowledge VQA), as well as\nan attack-and-defense framework to evaluate methods for deleting specific\nmultimodal knowledge from MLLMs. We extend a visual question-answering dataset\nusing an automated pipeline that generates varying-proximity samples for\ntesting generalization and specificity, followed by manual filtering for\nmaintaining high quality. We then evaluate six defense objectives against seven\nattacks (four whitebox, three blackbox), including a novel whitebox method\nleveraging interpretability of hidden states. Our results show multimodal\nattacks outperform text- or image-only ones, and that the most effective\ndefense removes answer information from internal model states. Additionally,\nlarger models exhibit greater post-editing robustness, suggesting that scale\nenhances safety. UnLOK-VQA provides a rigorous benchmark for advancing\nunlearning in MLLMs.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["benchmark", "evaluation", "dataset", "safety"], "score": 4}}, "source_file": "2025-05-06.jsonl"}

Yet, due to hardware\nlimitations, operational variability, and patient compliance, fundus images\noften suffer from low resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Recent years have\nwitnessed promising progress in fundus image enhancement. However, existing\nworks usually focus on restoring structural details or global characteristics\nof fundus images, lacking a unified image enhancement framework to recover\ncomprehensive multi-scale information. Moreover, few methods pinpoint the\ntarget of image enhancement, e.g., lesions, which is crucial for medical\nimage-based diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale\ntarget-aware representation learning framework (MTRL-FIE) for efficient fundus\nimage enhancement. Specifically, we propose a multi-scale feature encoder (MFE)\nthat employs wavelet decomposition to embed both low-frequency structural\ninformation and high-frequency details. Next, we design a structure-preserving\nhierarchical decoder (SHD) to fuse multi-scale feature embeddings for real\nfundus image restoration. SHD integrates hierarchical fusion and group\nattention mechanisms to achieve adaptive feature fusion while retaining local\nstructural smoothness. Meanwhile, a target-aware feature aggregation (TFA)\nmodule is used to enhance pathological regions and reduce artifacts.\nExperimental results on multiple fundus image datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness and generalizability of MTRL-FIE for fundus image enhancement.\nCompared to state-of-the-art methods, MTRL-FIE achieves superior enhancement\nperformance with a more lightweight architecture.
