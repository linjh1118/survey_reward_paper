TetWeave constructs tetrahedral grids on-the-fly via Delaunay\ntriangulation, enabling increased flexibility compared to predefined grids. The\nextracted meshes are guaranteed to be watertight, two-manifold and\nintersection-free. The flexibility of TetWeave enables a resampling strategy\nthat places new points where reconstruction error is high and allows to\nencourage mesh fairness without compromising on reconstruction error. This\nleads to high-quality, adaptive meshes that require minimal memory usage and\nfew parameters to optimize. Consequently, TetWeave exhibits near-linear memory\nscaling relative to the vertex count of the output mesh - a substantial\nimprovement over predefined grids. We demonstrate the applicability of TetWeave\nto a broad range of challenging tasks in computer graphics and vision, such as\nmulti-view 3D reconstruction, mesh compression and geometric texture\ngeneration.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scaling"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-05-08.jsonl"}

While recent advances in 3D\ncontent generation have shown remarkable progress, existing primitive\nabstraction methods either rely on geometric optimization with limited semantic\nunderstanding or learn from small-scale, category-specific datasets, struggling\nto generalize across diverse shape categories. We present PrimitiveAnything, a\nnovel framework that reformulates shape primitive abstraction as a primitive\nassembly generation task. PrimitiveAnything includes a shape-conditioned\nprimitive transformer for auto-regressive generation and an ambiguity-free\nparameterization scheme to represent multiple types of primitives in a unified\nmanner. The proposed framework directly learns the process of primitive\nassembly from large-scale human-crafted abstractions, enabling it to capture\nhow humans decompose complex shapes into primitive elements. Through extensive\nexperiments, we demonstrate that PrimitiveAnything can generate high-quality\nprimitive assemblies that better align with human perception while maintaining\ngeometric fidelity across diverse shape categories. It benefits various 3D\napplications and shows potential for enabling primitive-based user-generated\ncontent (UGC) in games.
