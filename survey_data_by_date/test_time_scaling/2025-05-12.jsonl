While\nrecent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) perform well on general image\ncaptioning, they often fail to capture the nuanced interpretations that fine\nart demands. We propose ArtRAG, a novel, training-free framework that combines\nstructured knowledge with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for\nmulti-perspective artwork explanation. ArtRAG automatically constructs an Art\nContext Knowledge Graph (ACKG) from domain-specific textual sources, organizing\nentities such as artists, movements, themes, and historical events into a rich,\ninterpretable graph. At inference time, a multi-granular structured retriever\nselects semantically and topologically relevant subgraphs to guide generation.\nThis enables MLLMs to produce contextually grounded, culturally informed art\ndescriptions. Experiments on the SemArt and Artpedia datasets show that ArtRAG\noutperforms several heavily trained baselines. Human evaluations further\nconfirm that ArtRAG generates coherent, insightful, and culturally enriched\ninterpretations.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["inference time"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-05-12.jsonl"}
