A key innovation in Qwen3 is\nthe integration of thinking mode (for complex, multi-step reasoning) and\nnon-thinking mode (for rapid, context-driven responses) into a unified\nframework. This eliminates the need to switch between different models--such as\nchat-optimized models (e.g., GPT-4o) and dedicated reasoning models (e.g.,\nQwQ-32B)--and enables dynamic mode switching based on user queries or chat\ntemplates. Meanwhile, Qwen3 introduces a thinking budget mechanism, allowing\nusers to allocate computational resources adaptively during inference, thereby\nbalancing latency and performance based on task complexity. Moreover, by\nleveraging the knowledge from the flagship models, we significantly reduce the\ncomputational resources required to build smaller-scale models, while ensuring\ntheir highly competitive performance.

ED\ndescribes the probability of finding electrons at specific locations around\natoms or molecules, which uniquely determines all ground state properties (such\nas energy, molecular structure, etc.) of interactive multi-particle systems\naccording to the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. However, the calculation of ED relies\non the time-consuming first-principles density functional theory (DFT) which\nleads to the lack of large-scale ED data and limits its application in MLFFs.\nIn this paper, we introduce EDBench, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of ED\ndesigned to advance learning-based research at the electronic scale. Built upon\nthe PCQM4Mv2, EDBench provides accurate ED data, covering 3.3 million\nmolecules. To comprehensively evaluate the ability of models to understand and\nutilize electronic information, we design a suite of ED-centric benchmark tasks\nspanning prediction, retrieval, and generation. Our evaluation on several\nstate-of-the-art methods demonstrates that learning from EDBench is not only\nfeasible but also achieves high accuracy. Moreover, we show that learning-based\nmethod can efficiently calculate ED with comparable precision while\nsignificantly reducing the computational cost relative to traditional DFT\ncalculations. All data and benchmarks from EDBench will be freely available,\nlaying a robust foundation for ED-driven drug discovery and materials science.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["benchmark", "evaluation", "dataset", "accuracy"], "score": 4}}, "source_file": "2025-05-15.jsonl"}
