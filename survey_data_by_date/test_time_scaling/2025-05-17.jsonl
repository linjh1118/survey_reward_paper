We introduce the third and\nmore inference-efficient scaling paradigm: increasing the model's parallel\ncomputation during both training and inference time. We apply $P$ diverse and\nlearnable transformations to the input, execute forward passes of the model in\nparallel, and dynamically aggregate the $P$ outputs. This method, namely\nparallel scaling (ParScale), scales parallel computation by reusing existing\nparameters and can be applied to any model structure, optimization procedure,\ndata, or task. We theoretically propose a new scaling law and validate it\nthrough large-scale pre-training, which shows that a model with $P$ parallel\nstreams is similar to scaling the parameters by $O(\\log P)$ while showing\nsuperior inference efficiency. For example, ParScale can use up to 22$\\times$\nless memory increase and 6$\\times$ less latency increase compared to parameter\nscaling that achieves the same performance improvement. It can also recycle an\noff-the-shelf pre-trained model into a parallelly scaled one by post-training\non a small amount of tokens, further reducing the training budget.

In real-world applications, models are\ntypically fixed after training. However, domain shifts caused by changes in the\nenvironment, sensor types, or sensor degradation often lead to a decline in\nmodel performance. Continuous Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) offers a solution by\nadapting a source-pretrained model to evolving, unlabeled target domains.\nDespite its potential, research on ALS point clouds remains limited, facing\nchallenges such as the absence of standardized datasets and the risk of\ncatastrophic forgetting and error accumulation during prolonged adaptation. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose APCoTTA, the first CTTA method tailored for\nALS point cloud semantic segmentation. We propose a dynamic trainable layer\nselection module. This module utilizes gradient information to select\nlow-confidence layers for training, and the remaining layers are kept frozen,\nmitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further reduce error accumulation, we\npropose an entropy-based consistency loss. By losing such samples based on\nentropy, we apply consistency loss only to the reliable samples, enhancing\nmodel stability. In addition, we propose a random parameter interpolation\nmechanism, which randomly blends parameters from the selected trainable layers\nwith those of the source model.

We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only\nthe most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of\nloss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature\nfrequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong\nsuperposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,\nthe loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide\nrange of feature frequency distributions.

However, adapting these models\nwith limited few-shot data often leads to overfitting, undermining their\nability to generalize to new tasks. To address this, we propose Multi-Modal\nRepresentation Learning (MMRL), which introduces a shared, learnable,\nmodality-agnostic representation space. MMRL generates space tokens projected\ninto both text and image encoders as representation tokens, enabling more\neffective cross-modal interactions. Unlike prior methods that mainly optimize\nclass token features, MMRL inserts representation tokens into higher encoder\nlayers--where task-specific features are more prominent--while preserving\ngeneral knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both class and\nrepresentation features are jointly optimized: a trainable projection layer is\napplied to representation tokens for task adaptation, while the projection\nlayer for class token remains frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. To\nfurther promote generalization, we introduce a regularization term aligning\nclass and text features with the frozen VLM's zero-shot features. At inference,\na decoupling strategy uses both class and representation features for base\ntasks, but only class features for novel tasks due to their stronger\ngeneralization. Building upon this, we propose MMRL++, a parameter-efficient\nand interaction-aware extension that significantly reduces trainable parameters\nand enhances intra-modal interactions--particularly across the layers of\nrepresentation tokens--allowing gradient sharing and instance-specific\ninformation to propagate more effectively through the network.

Surrogate models may allow for the accelerated\nevaluation of CPMs of complex biological systems. However, the stochastic\nnature of these models means each set of parameters may give rise to different\nmodel configurations, complicating surrogate model development. In this work,\nwe leverage denoising diffusion probabilistic models to train a generative AI\nsurrogate of a CPM used to investigate \\textit{in vitro} vasculogenesis. We\ndescribe the use of an image classifier to learn the characteristics that\ndefine unique areas of a 2-dimensional parameter space. We then apply this\nclassifier to aid in surrogate model selection and verification. Our CPM model\nsurrogate generates model configurations 20,000 timesteps ahead of a reference\nconfiguration and demonstrates approximately a 22x reduction in computational\ntime as compared to native code execution. Our work represents a step towards\nthe implementation of DDPMs to develop digital twins of stochastic biological\nsystems.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["evaluation"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-05-17.jsonl"}

This clinical context is defined by\nthe scarcity of independent multimodal datasets and the imperative to\namalgamate inherently misaligned modalities. As a result, algorithms are\nconstrained to train on approximate data and depend on application migration,\nleading to substantial resource expenditure and a potential decline in analysis\naccuracy. To address those challenges, we have made two major contributions:\nFirst, we publicly disseminate the GCM 2025 dataset, which serves as the first\nlarge-scale, open-source collection of gastric cancer multimodal MRI scans,\nfeaturing professionally annotated FS-T2W, CE-T1W, and ADC images from 500\npatients. Second, we introduce HWA-UNETR, a novel 3D segmentation framework\nthat employs an original HWA block with learnable window aggregation layers to\nestablish dynamic feature correspondences between different modalities'\nanatomical structures, and leverages the innovative tri-orientated fusion mamba\nmechanism for context modeling and capturing long-range spatial dependencies.\nExtensive experiments on our GCM 2025 dataset and the publicly BraTS 2021\ndataset validate the performance of our framework, demonstrating that the new\napproach surpasses existing methods by up to 1.68\\% in the Dice score while\nmaintaining solid robustness.
