We found that CLIP is\nespecially vulnerable to sensor degradation, a type of realistic distribution\nshift caused by sensor conditions such as weather, light, or noise. Collecting\na new dataset from a test distribution for fine-tuning highly costs since\nsensor degradation occurs unexpectedly and has a range of variety. Thus, we\ninvestigate test-time adaptation (TTA) of zero-shot classification, which\nenables on-the-fly adaptation to the test distribution with unlabeled test\ndata. Existing TTA methods for CLIP mainly focus on modifying image and text\nembeddings or predictions to address distribution shifts. Although these\nmethods can adapt to domain shifts, such as fine-grained labels spaces or\ndifferent renditions in input images, they fail to adapt to distribution shifts\ncaused by sensor degradation. We found that this is because image embeddings\nare \"corrupted\" in terms of uniformity, a measure related to the amount of\ninformation. To make models robust to sensor degradation, we propose a novel\nmethod called uniformity-aware information-balanced TTA (UnInfo). To address\nthe corruption of image embeddings, we introduce uniformity-aware confidence\nmaximization, information-aware loss balancing, and knowledge distillation from\nthe exponential moving average (EMA) teacher. Through experiments, we\ndemonstrate that our UnInfo improves accuracy under sensor degradation by\nretaining information in terms of uniformity.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["test-time", "test-time adaptation"], "score": 2}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["dataset", "accuracy", "fine-grained"], "score": 3}}, "source_file": "2025-05-20.jsonl"}

However, existing methods typically\nrely on auxiliary mechanisms to identify important or irrelevant task-specific\ntokens, introducing potential bias and limiting applicability. In this paper,\nwe uncover a surprising and elegant alternative: the semantically empty initial\ntoken is a powerful and underexplored control point for optimizing model\nbehavior. Through theoretical analysis, we show that tuning the initial token's\nattention sharpens or flattens the attention distribution over subsequent\ntokens, and its role as an attention sink amplifies this effect. Empirically,\nwe find that: (1) tuning its attention improves LLM performance more\neffectively than tuning other task-specific tokens; (2) the effect follows a\nconsistent trend across layers, with earlier layers having greater impact, but\nvaries across attention heads, with different heads showing distinct\npreferences in how they attend to this token. Based on these findings, we\npropose ZeroTuning, a training-free approach that improves LLM performance by\napplying head-specific attention adjustments to this special token.

Previous works often interpret this\nphenomenon in the context of domain shift, developing fine-tuning methods that\naim to preserve the original domain as much as possible. However, in a\ndifferent context, fine-tuned models with limited data are also prone to\nlearning features that are spurious to humans, such as background or texture.\nIn this paper, we propose StarFT (Spurious Textual Alignment Regularization), a\nnovel framework for fine-tuning zero-shot models to enhance robustness by\npreventing them from learning spuriosity. We introduce a regularization that\naligns the output distribution for spuriosity-injected labels with the original\nzero-shot model, ensuring that the model is not induced to extract irrelevant\nfeatures further from these descriptions.We leverage recent language models to\nget such spuriosity-injected labels by generating alternative textual\ndescriptions that highlight potentially confounding features.Extensive\nexperiments validate the robust generalization of StarFT and its emerging\nproperties: zero-shot group robustness and improved zero-shot classification.\nNotably, StarFT boosts both worst-group and average accuracy by 14.30% and\n3.02%, respectively, in the Waterbirds group shift scenario, where other robust\nfine-tuning baselines show even degraded performance.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["accuracy"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-05-20.jsonl"}

In addition to a\nsingle-scale network for global structure alignment, we introduce a framework\nthat utilizes dense tissue information to track breast movement. The learned\ntransformation fields are fused by introducing the Dual Spatial Transformer\nNetwork (DSTN), improving overall alignment accuracy. A novel warping method\nbased on the Euclidean distance transform (EDT) is also proposed to accurately\nwarp the registered dense tissue and breast masks, preserving fine structural\ndetails during deformation. The framework supports paradigms that require\nexternal segmentation models and with image data only. It also operates\neffectively with the VoxelMorph and TransMorph backbones, offering a versatile\nsolution for breast registration.

In this\npaper, we aim to push the limits of memory-efficient training by minimizing\nmemory usage on model weights, gradients, and optimizer states, within a\nunified framework. Our idea is to eliminate both gradients and optimizer states\nusing zeroth-order optimization, which approximates gradients by perturbing\nweights during forward passes to identify gradient directions. To minimize\nmemory usage on weights, we employ model quantization, e.g., converting from\nbfloat16 to int4. However, directly applying zeroth-order optimization to\nquantized weights is infeasible due to the precision gap between discrete\nweights and continuous gradients, which would otherwise require de-quantization\nand re-quantization. To overcome this challenge, we propose Quantized\nZeroth-order Optimization (QZO), a novel approach that perturbs the continuous\nquantization scale for gradient estimation and uses a directional derivative\nclipping method to stabilize training. QZO is orthogonal to both scalar-based\nand codebook-based post-training quantization methods.
