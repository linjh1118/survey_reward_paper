To address this, we propose the Leveraging Motion\nPrior (LMP) framework for zero-shot video generation. Our framework harnesses\nthe powerful generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion transformers to\nenable motion in the generated videos to reference user-provided motion videos\nin both text-to-video and image-to-video generation. To this end, we first\nintroduce a foreground-background disentangle module to distinguish between\nmoving subjects and backgrounds in the reference video, preventing interference\nin the target video generation. A reweighted motion transfer module is designed\nto allow the target video to reference the motion from the reference video.

A multitude of approaches have been proposed to exploit\nin-session context for improved document ranking. Despite these advances, the\nlimitation of historical session data for capturing evolving user intent\nremains a challenge. In this work, we explore the integration of future\ncontextual information into the session context to enhance document ranking. We\npresent the siamese model optimization framework, comprising a\nhistory-conditioned model and a future-aware model. The former processes only\nthe historical behavior sequence, while the latter integrates both historical\nand anticipated future behaviors. Both models are trained collaboratively using\nthe supervised labels and pseudo labels predicted by the other. The\nhistory-conditioned model, referred to as ForeRanker, progressively learns\nfuture-relevant information to enhance ranking, while it singly uses historical\nsession at inference time. To mitigate inconsistencies during training, we\nintroduce the peer knowledge distillation method with a dynamic gating\nmechanism, allowing models to selectively incorporate contextual information.\nExperimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nForeRanker, showcasing its superior performance compared to existing methods.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["inference time"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["ranking"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["benchmark"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-05-21.jsonl"}

Our approach is two-fold: (1)\nwe retrieve analogous problems and use their proofs to guide the LLM, and (2) a\nformal verifier evaluates the generated proofs and provides feedback, helping\nthe model fix incorrect proofs. We demonstrate that our method significantly\nimproves proof accuracy for OpenAI's o1 model (58%-70% improvement); both\nanalogous problems and the verifier's feedback contribute to these gains. More\nbroadly, shifting to LLMs that generate provably correct conclusions could\ndramatically improve their reliability, accuracy and consistency, unlocking\ncomplex tasks and critical real-world applications that require\ntrustworthiness.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["o1"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["consistency", "reliability", "accuracy"], "score": 3}}, "source_file": "2025-05-21.jsonl"}

However, tasks that require complex reasoning or\ndeep contextual understanding are often hindered by biases or interference from\nthe base model when using typical decoding methods like greedy or beam search.\nThese biases can lead to generic or task-agnostic responses from the base model\ninstead of leveraging the LoRA-specific adaptations. In this paper, we\nintroduce Contrastive LoRA Decoding (CoLD), a novel decoding framework designed\nto maximize the use of task-specific knowledge in LoRA-adapted models,\nresulting in better downstream performance. CoLD uses contrastive decoding by\nscoring candidate tokens based on the divergence between the probability\ndistributions of a LoRA-adapted expert model and the corresponding base model.\nThis approach prioritizes tokens that better align with the LoRA's learned\nrepresentations, enhancing performance for specialized tasks. While effective,\na naive implementation of CoLD is computationally expensive because each\ndecoding step requires evaluating multiple token candidates across both models.\nTo address this, we developed an optimized kernel for Huawei's Ascend NPU. CoLD\nachieves up to a 5.54% increase in task accuracy while reducing end-to-end\nlatency by 28% compared to greedy decoding.

However, while this paradigm\nenhances convenience, it disrupts the feedback-driven improvement loop that has\nhistorically powered the evolution of traditional Web search. Web search can\ncontinuously improve their ranking models by collecting large-scale,\nfine-grained user feedback (e.g., clicks, dwell time) at the document level. In\ncontrast, generative AI search operates through a much longer search pipeline,\nspanning query decomposition, document retrieval, and answer generation, yet\ntypically receives only coarse-grained feedback on the final answer. This\nintroduces a feedback loop disconnect, where user feedback for the final output\ncannot be effectively mapped back to specific system components, making it\ndifficult to improve each intermediate stage and sustain the feedback loop. In\nthis paper, we envision NExT-Search, a next-generation paradigm designed to\nreintroduce fine-grained, process-level feedback into generative AI search.\nNExT-Search integrates two complementary modes: User Debug Mode, which allows\nengaged users to intervene at key stages; and Shadow User Mode, where a\npersonalized user agent simulates user preferences and provides AI-assisted\nfeedback for less interactive users. Furthermore, we envision how these\nfeedback signals can be leveraged through online adaptation, which refines\ncurrent search outputs in real-time, and offline update, which aggregates\ninteraction logs to periodically fine-tune query decomposition, retrieval, and\ngeneration models. By restoring human control over key stages of the generative\nAI search pipeline, we believe NExT-Search offers a promising direction for\nbuilding feedback-rich AI search systems that can evolve continuously alongside\nhuman feedback.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["human feedback", "ranking"], "score": 2}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["fine-grained"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-05-21.jsonl"}
