Do people prefer precise edits with predictable outcomes or highly\ncreative ones? By understanding the characteristics of real-world requests and\nthe corresponding edits made by freelance photo-editing wizards, can we draw\nlessons for improving AI-based editors and determine which types of requests\ncan currently be handled successfully by AI editors? In this paper, we present\na unique study addressing these questions by analyzing 83k requests from the\npast 12 years (2013-2025) on the Reddit community, which collected 305k\nPSR-wizard edits. According to human ratings, approximately only 33% of\nrequests can be fulfilled by the best AI editors (including GPT-4o,\nGemini-2.0-Flash, SeedEdit). Interestingly, AI editors perform worse on\nlow-creativity requests that require precise editing than on more open-ended\ntasks. They often struggle to preserve the identity of people and animals, and\nfrequently make non-requested touch-ups. On the other side of the table, VLM\njudges (e.g., o1) perform differently from human judges and may prefer AI edits\nmore than human edits.

In this paper, we present\na benchmark, dubbed RBench-V, designed to assess models' vision-indispensable\nreasoning abilities. To construct RBench-V, we carefully hand-pick 803\nquestions covering math, physics, counting, and games. Unlike previous\nbenchmarks that typically specify certain input modalities, RBench-V presents\nproblems centered on multi-modal outputs, which require image manipulation such\nas generating novel images and constructing auxiliary lines to support the\nreasoning process. We evaluate numerous open- and closed-source models on\nRBench-V, including o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Qwen2.5-VL, etc. Even the\nbest-performing model, o3, achieves only 25.8% accuracy on RBench-V, far below\nthe human score of 82.3%, highlighting that current models struggle to leverage\nmulti-modal reasoning.

According to the scaling laws, larger models\ntypically show higher capabilities. However, in practice, resource costs are\nalso an important factor and thus it makes sense to consider the ratio between\nmodel performance and costs. The LLM-KG-Bench framework enables the comparison\nof LLMs in the context of KGE tasks and assesses their capabilities of\nunderstanding and producing KGs and KG queries. Based on a dataset created in\nan LLM-KG-Bench run covering 26 open state-of-the-art LLMs, we explore the\nmodel size scaling laws specific to KGE tasks. In our analyses, we assess how\nbenchmark scores evolve between different model size categories. Additionally,\nwe inspect how the general score development of single models and families of\nmodels correlates to their size. Our analyses revealed that, with a few\nexceptions, the model size scaling laws generally also apply to the selected\nKGE tasks. However, in some cases, plateau or ceiling effects occurred, i.e.,\nthe task performance did not change much between a model and the next larger\nmodel. In these cases, smaller models could be considered to achieve high\ncost-effectiveness. Regarding models of the same family, sometimes larger\nmodels performed worse than smaller models of the same family. These effects\noccurred only locally.

These encompass\nensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and\ndesigning sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler\nrule-based rewards. While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these\nexplorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific\nchallenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies. To bridge this\ngap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO\nalgorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain\nperformance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of\ndifferent reward models on their respective capabilities. Our findings reveal\nthat GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward\nmodels possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially\nenhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. Furthermore,\nwe systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both\ntheir in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into\nefficiently scaling performance for each paradigm. We hope our study paves a\nnew path for inspiring future work on developing more effective RL algorithms\nto achieve robust CoT reasoning in the realm of autoregressive image\ngeneration.
