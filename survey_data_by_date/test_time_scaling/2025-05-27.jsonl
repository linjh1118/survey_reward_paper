In this\nwork, we introduce ALTPRAG, a dataset grounded in the pragmatic concept of\nalternatives, designed to evaluate whether LLMs at different training stages\ncan accurately infer nuanced speaker intentions. Each instance pairs two\ncontextually appropriate but pragmatically distinct continuations, enabling\nfine-grained assessment of both pragmatic interpretation and contrastive\nreasoning. We systematically evaluate 22 LLMs across key training stages:\npre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and preference optimization, to\nexamine the development of pragmatic competence. Our results show that even\nbase models exhibit notable sensitivity to pragmatic cues, which improves\nconsistently with increases in model and data scale. Additionally, SFT and RLHF\ncontribute further gains, particularly in cognitive-pragmatic reasoning.

A major challenge in\nstudent simulation is modeling the diverse learning patterns of students at\nvarious cognitive levels. However, current LLMs, typically trained as ``helpful\nassistants'', target at generating perfect responses. As a result, they\nstruggle to simulate students with diverse cognitive abilities, as they often\nproduce overly advanced answers, missing the natural imperfections that\ncharacterize student learning and resulting in unrealistic simulations. To\naddress this issue, we propose a training-free framework for student\nsimulation. We begin by constructing a cognitive prototype for each student\nusing a knowledge graph, which captures their understanding of concepts from\npast learning records. This prototype is then mapped to new tasks to predict\nstudent performance. Next, we simulate student solutions based on these\npredictions and iteratively refine them using a beam search method to better\nreplicate realistic mistakes. To validate our approach, we construct the\n\\texttt{Student\\_100} dataset, consisting of $100$ students working on Python\nprogramming and $5,000$ learning records.

Through large-scale empirical analyses spanning over\n300 training runs, carefully controlled for data scale and quality, we show\nthat data diversity can be a strong predictor of generalization in LLM\nreasoning -- as measured by average model performance on unseen\nout-of-distribution benchmarks.
