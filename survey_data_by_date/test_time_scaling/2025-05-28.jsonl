Understanding\nthe proficiency of LLMs in these domains is critical for evaluating their\npractical utility and guiding future developments. The POSCOMP, a prestigious\nBrazilian examination used for graduate admissions in computer science promoted\nby the Brazlian Computer Society (SBC), provides a challenging benchmark. This\nstudy investigates whether LLMs can match or surpass human performance on the\nPOSCOMP exam. Four LLMs - ChatGPT-4, Gemini 1.0 Advanced, Claude 3 Sonnet, and\nLe Chat Mistral Large - were initially evaluated on the 2022 and 2023 POSCOMP\nexams. The assessments measured the models' proficiency in handling complex\nquestions typical of the exam. LLM performance was notably better on text-based\nquestions than on image interpretation tasks. In the 2022 exam, ChatGPT-4 led\nwith 57 correct answers out of 69 questions, followed by Gemini 1.0 Advanced\n(49), Le Chat Mistral (48), and Claude 3 Sonnet (44). Similar trends were\nobserved in the 2023 exam. ChatGPT-4 achieved the highest performance,\nsurpassing all students who took the POSCOMP 2023 exam. LLMs, particularly\nChatGPT-4, show promise in text-based tasks on the POSCOMP exam, although image\ninterpretation remains a challenge. Given the rapid evolution of LLMs, we\nexpanded our analysis to include more recent models - o1, Gemini 2.5 Pro,\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet, and o3-mini-high - evaluated on the 2022-2024 POSCOMP exams.\nThese newer models demonstrate further improvements and consistently surpass\nboth the average and top-performing human participants across all three years.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["o1"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["benchmark"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-05-28.jsonl"}

Existing works leverage agent-based divide-and-conquer\nmethods for processing long contexts. But these methods face crucial\nlimitations, including prohibitive accumulated latency and amplified\ninformation loss from excessive agent invocations, and the disruption of\ninherent textual dependencies by immoderate partitioning. In this paper, we\npropose a novel multi-agent framework XpandA (Expand-Agent) coupled with\nquestion-driven workflow and dynamic partitioning for robust long-context\nprocessing. XpandA overcomes these limitations through: 1) dynamic partitioning\nof long texts, which adaptively modulates the filling rate of context windows\nfor input sequences of vastly varying lengths; 2) question-guided protocol to\nupdate flat information ensembles within centralized shared memory,\nconstructing consistent inter-agent knowledge across partitions; and 3)\nselectively replaying specific partitions based on the state-tracking of\nquestion-information couples to promote the resolution of inverted-order\nstructures across partitions (e.g., flashbacks). We perform a comprehensive\nevaluation of XpandA on multiple long-context benchmarks with length varying\nfrom 1k to 1M, demonstrating XpandA's feasibility for processing ultra-long\nsequences and its significant effectiveness in enhancing the long-context\ncapabilities of various LLMs by achieving 20\\% improvements and 1.5x inference\nspeedup over baselines of full-context, RAG and previous agent-based methods.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scaling"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["evaluation"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-05-28.jsonl"}

First, there is a need for hierarchical\npersonalized representations for users. Previous approaches have typically used\nusers' search behavior as a single, overall representation, which proves\ninadequate in more nuanced generative scenarios. Additionally, query prefixes\nare typically short and may contain typos or sensitive information, increasing\nthe likelihood of generating toxic content compared to traditional text\ngeneration tasks. Such toxic content can degrade user experience and lead to\npublic relations issues. Therefore, the second critical challenge is\ndetoxifying QAC systems.\n  To address these two limitations, we propose a novel model (LaD) that\ncaptures personalized information from both long-term and short-term interests,\nincorporating adaptive detoxification. In LaD, personalized information is\ncaptured hierarchically at both coarse-grained and fine-grained levels. This\napproach preserves as much personalized information as possible while enabling\nonline generation within time constraints. To move a futher step, we propose an\nonline training method based on Reject Preference Optimization (RPO). By\nincorporating a special token [Reject] during both the training and inference\nprocesses, the model achieves adaptive detoxification. Consequently, the\ngenerated text presented to users is both non-toxic and relevant to the given\nprefix.
