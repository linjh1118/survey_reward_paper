However, existing algorithms are not easily scalable\ndue to the limitations of near-term quantum devices. Following our previous\nwork on QDMs, here we propose and implement two physics-inspired protocols. In\nthe first, we use the formalism of quantum stochastic walks, showing that a\nspecific interplay of quantum and classical dynamics in the forward process\nproduces statistically more robust models generating sets of MNIST images with\nlower Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) than using totally classical dynamics.\nIn the second approach, we realize an algorithm to generate images by\nexploiting the intrinsic noise of real IBM quantum hardware with only four\nqubits. Our work could be a starting point to pave the way for new scenarios\nfor large-scale algorithms in quantum Generative AI, where quantum noise is\nneither mitigated nor corrected, but instead exploited as a useful resource.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-05-29.jsonl"}

Many of these systems utilize\ndiffractive optical components (DOEs) for holography, PSF engineering, or\nwavefront shaping. Existing approaches have, however, mostly remained limited\nto laboratory prototypes, owing to a large quality gap between simulation and\nmanufactured devices. We aim at lifting the fundamental technical barriers to\nthe practical use of learned diffractive optical systems. To this end, we\npropose a fabrication-aware design pipeline for diffractive optics fabricated\nby direct-write grayscale lithography followed by nano-imprinting replication,\nwhich is directly suited for inexpensive mass production of large area designs.\nWe propose a super-resolved neural lithography model that can accurately\npredict the 3D geometry generated by the fabrication process. This model can be\nseamlessly integrated into existing differentiable optics frameworks, enabling\nfabrication-aware, end-to-end optimization of computational optical systems. To\ntackle the computational challenges, we also devise tensor-parallel compute\nframework centered on distributing large-scale FFT computation across many\nGPUs. As such, we demonstrate large scale diffractive optics designs up to\n32.16 mm $\\times$ 21.44 mm, simulated on grids of up to 128,640 by 85,760\nfeature points. We find adequate agreement between simulation and fabricated\nprototypes for applications such as holography and PSF engineering. We also\nachieve high image quality from an imaging system comprised only of a single\nDOE, with images processed only by a Wiener filter utilizing the simulation\nPSF.

While \"aha moment\"\npatterns--where models exhibit self-correction through reflection--are often\nattributed to emergent properties from RL, we first demonstrate that these\npatterns exist in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) prior to RL training but may not\nnecessarily correlate with improved reasoning performance. Building on these\ninsights, we present a comprehensive study on enhancing multimodal reasoning\nthrough a two-stage approach: (1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start\nwith structured chain-of-thought reasoning patterns, followed by (2)\nreinforcement learning via GRPO to further refine these capabilities.
