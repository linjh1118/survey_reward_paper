However,\npopular image vectorization tools struggle with occluded regions, producing\nincomplete or fragmented shapes that hinder editability. While recent\nadvancements have explored rule-based and data-driven layer-wise image\nvectorization, these methods face limitations in vectorization quality and\nflexibility. In this paper, we introduce LayerPeeler, a novel layer-wise image\nvectorization approach that addresses these challenges through a progressive\nsimplification paradigm. The key to LayerPeeler's success lies in its\nautoregressive peeling strategy: by identifying and removing the topmost\nnon-occluded layers while recovering underlying content, we generate vector\ngraphics with complete paths and coherent layer structures. Our method\nleverages vision-language models to construct a layer graph that captures\nocclusion relationships among elements, enabling precise detection and\ndescription for non-occluded layers. These descriptive captions are used as\nediting instructions for a finetuned image diffusion model to remove the\nidentified layers. To ensure accurate removal, we employ localized attention\ncontrol that precisely guides the model to target regions while faithfully\npreserving the surrounding content. To support this, we contribute a\nlarge-scale dataset specifically designed for layer peeling tasks.

However, improving their\nspatial intelligence remains a challenge. Existing 3D MLLMs always rely on\nadditional 3D or 2.5D data to incorporate spatial awareness, restricting their\nutility in scenarios with only 2D inputs, such as images or videos. In this\npaper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial\nreasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which\nrely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our\nkey insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward\nvisual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder\narchitecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and\na spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to\nextract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into\nunified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we\npropose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects\nthe spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under\nlimited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial\nreasoning.
