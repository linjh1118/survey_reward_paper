Unlike conventional\nPrivilege Learning, where ground-truth-derived guidance is typically discarded\nafter training, SIPL empowers the model to leverage its own preliminary outputs\nas pseudo-privileged signals for iterative self-refinement at test time.\nCentral to SIPL is Proxy Fusion, a lightweight module incorporating a learnable\nPrivileged Dictionary.

We argue that such systems have\npreviously been unable to represent human meaning because they rely on thin\ndescriptions: numerical representations that enforce standardization and\ntherefore strip human activity of the cultural context that gives it meaning.\nBy contrast, scholars in the humanities and qualitative social sciences have\ndeveloped frameworks for representing meaning through thick description: verbal\nrepresentations that accommodate heterogeneity and retain contextual\ninformation needed to represent human meaning. While these methods can\neffectively codify meaning, they are difficult to deploy at scale. However, the\nverbal capabilities of LLMs now provide a means of (at least partially)\nautomating the generation and processing of thick descriptions, potentially\novercoming this bottleneck.

LitChat automatically interprets user queries, retrieves relevant\nsources, constructs knowledge graphs, and employs diverse data-mining\ntechniques to generate evidence-based insights addressing user needs.

We find that\nsteering effectively controls the targeted summary properties, but high\nsteering strengths consistently degrade both intrinsic and extrinsic text\nquality. Compared to steering, prompting offers weaker control, while\npreserving text quality. Combining steering and prompting yields the strongest\ncontrol over text properties and offers the most favorable efficacy-quality\ntrade-off at moderate steering strengths. Our results underscore the practical\ntrade-off between control strength and text quality preservation when applying\nsteering vectors to free-form generation tasks.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["inference time"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["dataset", "summarization"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-06-02.jsonl"}

To\naddress this, we introduce Agent-X, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating\nvision-centric agents multi-step and deep reasoning capabilities in real-world,\nmultimodal settings. Agent- X features 828 agentic tasks with authentic visual\ncontexts, including images, multi-image comparisons, videos, and instructional\ntext. These tasks span six major agentic environments: general visual\nreasoning, web browsing, security and surveillance, autonomous driving, sports,\nand math reasoning. Our benchmark requires agents to integrate tool use with\nexplicit, stepwise decision-making in these diverse settings. In addition, we\npropose a fine-grained, step-level evaluation framework that assesses the\ncorrectness and logical coherence of each reasoning step and the effectiveness\nof tool usage throughout the task. Our results reveal that even the\nbest-performing models, including GPT, Gemini, and Qwen families, struggle to\nsolve multi-step vision tasks, achieving less than 50% full-chain success.\nThese findings highlight key bottlenecks in current LMM reasoning and tool-use\ncapabilities and identify future research directions in vision-centric agentic\nreasoning models.
