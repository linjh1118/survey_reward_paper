In the anisotropic formulation,\nuncertainties of the estimated relative rotations -- obtained via standard\ntwo-view optimization -- are propagated to the optimization of absolute\nrotations. The resulting semidefinite relaxations are able to recover global\nminima but scale poorly with the problem size. Local methods are fast and also\nadmit robust estimation but are sensitive to initialization. They usually\nemploy minimum spanning trees and therefore suffer from drift accumulation and\ncan get trapped in poor local minima. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the\ngap between optimality, robustness and efficiency of anisotropic rotation\naveraging. We analyze a family of block coordinate descent methods initially\nproposed to optimize the standard chordal distances, and derive a much simpler\nformulation and an anisotropic extension obtaining a fast general solver.

We build on this idea by extending the conceptual framework where\nrepresentations learned across models trained on the same data can be expressed\nas linear combinations of a \\emph{universal} set of basis features. These basis\nfeatures underlie the learning task itself and remain consistent across models,\nregardless of scale. From this framework, we propose the \\textbf{Linear\nRepresentation Transferability (LRT)} Hypothesis -- that there exists an affine\ntransformation between the representation spaces of different models. To test\nthis hypothesis, we learn affine mappings between the hidden states of models\nof different sizes and evaluate whether steering vectors -- directions in\nhidden state space associated with specific model behaviors -- retain their\nsemantic effect when transferred from small to large language models using the\nlearned mappings. We find strong empirical evidence that such affine mappings\ncan preserve steering behaviors. These findings suggest that representations\nlearned by small models can be used to guide the behavior of large models, and\nthat the LRT hypothesis may be a promising direction on understanding\nrepresentation alignment across model scales.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-06-03.jsonl"}

A common approach involves\ncollecting scenario-specific data and performing fine-tuning via\nbackpropagation. However, this process is often impractical on edge devices due\nto constrained computational resources. To address this challenge, we introduce\nTrajICL, an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for pedestrian trajectory\nprediction that enables rapid adaptation without fine-tuning on the\nscenario-specific data. We propose a spatio-temporal similarity-based example\nselection (STES) method that selects relevant examples from previously observed\ntrajectories within the same scene by identifying similar motion patterns at\ncorresponding locations. To further refine this selection, we introduce\nprediction-guided example selection (PG-ES), which selects examples based on\nboth the past trajectory and the predicted future trajectory, rather than\nrelying solely on the past trajectory. This approach allows the model to\naccount for long-term dynamics when selecting examples. Finally, instead of\nrelying on small real-world datasets with limited scenario diversity, we train\nour model on a large-scale synthetic dataset to enhance its prediction ability\nby leveraging in-context examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nTrajICL achieves remarkable adaptation across both in-domain and cross-domain\nscenarios, outperforming even fine-tuned approaches across multiple public\nbenchmarks.
