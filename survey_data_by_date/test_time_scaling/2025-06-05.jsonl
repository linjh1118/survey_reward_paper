We argue that a robust object referring model\nshould be grounded, meaning its predictions should be both explainable and\nfaithful to the visual content. Specifically, it should satisfy two key\nproperties: 1) Verifiable, by producing interpretable reasoning that justifies\nits predictions and clearly links them to visual evidence; and 2) Trustworthy,\nby learning to abstain when no object in the image satisfies the given\nexpression. However, most methods treat referring as a direct bounding box\nprediction task, offering limited interpretability and struggling to reject\nexpressions with no matching object. In this work, we propose Rex-Thinker, a\nmodel that formulates object referring as an explicit CoT reasoning task. Given\na referring expression, we first identify all candidate object instances\ncorresponding to the referred object category. Rex-Thinker then performs\nstep-by-step reasoning over each candidate to assess whether it matches the\ngiven expression, before making a final prediction. To support this paradigm,\nwe construct a large-scale CoT-style referring dataset named HumanRef-CoT by\nprompting GPT-4o on the HumanRef dataset. Each reasoning trace follows a\nstructured planning, action, and summarization format, enabling the model to\nlearn decomposed, interpretable reasoning over object candidates. We then train\nRex-Thinker in two stages: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase to teach\nthe model how to perform structured reasoning, followed by GRPO-based RL\nlearning to improve accuracy and generalization.

This architecture eliminates the need for\ndense sensor arrays or extensive data acquisition; instead, it uses a\nspatially-optimized passive diffractive layer that encodes 3D structural\ndisplacements into modulated light, captured by a minimal number of detectors\nand decoded in real-time by shallow and low-power neural networks to\nreconstruct the 3D displacement spectra of structures. The diffractive system's\nefficacy was demonstrated both numerically and experimentally using\nmillimeter-wave illumination on a laboratory-scale building model with a\nprogrammable shake table. Our system achieves more than an order-of-magnitude\nimprovement in accuracy over conventional optics or separately trained modules,\nestablishing a foundation for high-throughput 3D monitoring of structures.\nBeyond SHM, the 3D vibration monitoring capabilities of this cost-effective and\ndata-efficient framework establish a new computational sensing modality with\npotential applications in disaster resilience, aerospace diagnostics, and\nautonomous navigation, where energy efficiency, low latency, and\nhigh-throughput are critical.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["safety", "accuracy"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-06-05.jsonl"}
