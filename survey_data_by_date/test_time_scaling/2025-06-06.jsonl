During inference, an image is generated by predicting all\nthe tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in\nall previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from\nreduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a\nresolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image\nresolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.\n  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image\ngeneration algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction\nand masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR\nreformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the\nprediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its\nimmediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.\nWhen predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked\ngeneration procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step.

However, extending such\ncapabilities to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging\ndue to the high cost of retraining vision-language alignments when upgrading\nthe underlying reasoner LLMs. A straightforward solution is to decouple\nperception from reasoning, i.e., converting visual inputs into language\nrepresentations (e.g., captions) that are then passed to a powerful text-only\nreasoner. However, this decoupling introduces a critical challenge: the visual\nextractor must generate descriptions that are both faithful to the image and\ninformative enough to support accurate downstream reasoning. To address this,\nwe propose Reasoning-Aligned Perceptual Decoupling via Caption Reward\nOptimization (RACRO) - a reasoning-guided reinforcement learning strategy that\naligns the extractor's captioning behavior with the reasoning objective.

Additionally, it relies on a 1B transformer\narchitecture (VAR-d24), and leverages a large-scale private dataset to achieve\nstate-of-the-art results. We address these limitations through two novel\ncomponents: a) a Hierarchical Image Tokenization approach with a multi-scale\nimage tokenizer that progressively represents images at different scales while\nsimultaneously enforcing token overlap across scales, and b) a Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) regularization term that, relying solely on the\nLR and HR tokenizations, encourages the transformer to produce the latter over\nthe former.

We\nintroduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally\nfine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K\ntriplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing\non temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the\nsame video, limiting practical usefulness.

As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a\ncontrolled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the\nnegative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the\neffectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments\non ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed\ndiscussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical\nvalidation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-06-06.jsonl"}
