Extending the reasoning\nchain at test time through deeper thought processes or broader exploration, can\nfurthur improve performance, but often incurs substantial costs due to the\nexplosion in token usage. Yet, many reasoning steps are relatively simple and\ncan be handled by more efficient smaller-scale language models (SLMs). This\nmotivates hybrid approaches that allocate subtasks across models of varying\ncapacities. However, realizing such collaboration requires accurate task\ndecomposition and difficulty-aware subtask allocation, which is challenging. To\naddress this, we propose R2-Reasoner, a novel framework that enables\ncollaborative reasoning across heterogeneous LLMs by dynamically routing\nsub-tasks based on estimated complexity. At the core of our framework is a\nReinforced Model Router, composed of a task decomposer and a subtask allocator.\nThe task decomposer segments complex input queries into logically ordered\nsubtasks, while the subtask allocator assigns each subtask to the most\nappropriate model, ranging from lightweight SLMs to powerful LLMs, balancing\naccuracy and efficiency. To train this router, we introduce a staged pipeline\nthat combines supervised fine-tuning on task-specific datasets with Group\nRelative Policy Optimization algorithm, enabling self-supervised refinement\nthrough iterative reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across four\nchallenging benchmarks demonstrate that R2-Reasoner reduces API costs by 86.85%\nwhile maintaining or surpassing baseline accuracy.
