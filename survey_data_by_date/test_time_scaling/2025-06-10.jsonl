However, existing motion-capture techniques and generative\nmodels often neglect physical constraints, leading to artifacts such as\ninterpenetration, sliding, and floating. These issues are exacerbated in\nmulti-person motion generation, where complex interactions are involved. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce physical mapping, integrated throughout\nthe human interaction generation pipeline. Specifically, motion imitation\nwithin a physics-based simulation environment is used to project target motions\ninto a physically valid space. The resulting motions are adjusted to adhere to\nreal-world physics constraints while retaining their original semantic meaning.\nThis mapping not only improves MoCap data quality but also directly informs\npost-processing of generated motions. Given the unique interactivity of\nmulti-person scenarios, we propose a tailored motion representation framework.\nMotion Consistency (MC) and Marker-based Interaction (MI) loss functions are\nintroduced to improve model performance.

To further reduce the memory footprint\nof the vision encoder, we propose the distillation-aware training strategy that\ncompresses the full-precision encoder to 1.58-bit weights. During this process,\na full-precision encoder serves as a teacher model to better align latent\nrepresentations. Despite the lack of large-scale robotics pretraining, BitVLA\nachieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model OpenVLA-OFT with\n4-bit post-training quantization on the LIBERO benchmark, while consuming only\n29.8% of the memory. These results highlight BitVLA's promise for deployment on\nmemory-constrained edge devices.

However, most\nexisting neural B-frame codecs directly adopt P-frame coding tools without\nadequately addressing the unique challenges of B-frame compression, leading to\nsuboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose novel enhancements for\nmotion compression and temporal fusion for neural B-frame coding. First, we\ndesign a fine-grained motion compression method. This method incorporates an\ninteractive dual-branch motion auto-encoder with per-branch adaptive\nquantization steps, which enables fine-grained compression of bi-directional\nmotion vectors while accommodating their asymmetric bitrate allocation and\nreconstruction quality requirements. Furthermore, this method involves an\ninteractive motion entropy model that exploits correlations between\nbi-directional motion latent representations by interactively leveraging\npartitioned latent segments as directional priors. Second, we propose a\nselective temporal fusion method that predicts bi-directional fusion weights to\nachieve discriminative utilization of bi-directional multi-scale temporal\ncontexts with varying qualities. Additionally, this method introduces a\nhyperprior-based implicit alignment mechanism for contextual entropy modeling.\nBy treating the hyperprior as a surrogate for the contextual latent\nrepresentation, this mechanism implicitly mitigates the misalignment in the\nfused bi-directional temporal priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour proposed codec outperforms state-of-the-art neural B-frame codecs and\nachieves comparable or even superior compression performance to the H.266/VVC\nreference software under random-access configurations.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["fine-grained"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-06-10.jsonl"}
