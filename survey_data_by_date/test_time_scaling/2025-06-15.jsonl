Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality\nreal-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this\npaper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world\nsimulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the\nfollowing characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on\nvideos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due\nto their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs\nmultiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and\nhigh-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes\nvideos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g.,\ntext, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable\nforensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect\nhigh-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing\npotential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a\nsimple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency\nas a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments\nshow that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising\ndirection for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical\nplausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated\nvideo detection.

Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated\nstrong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free\nguidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods\nlack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be\napplied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where\nquality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer\nlevel down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads\ngovern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.\nBuilding on this insight, we propose \"HeadHunter\", a systematic framework for\niteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,\nenabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In\naddition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected\nhead's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to\ntune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only\nmitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but\nalso enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through\ncompositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale\nDiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,\ndemonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and\nstyle-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of\nattention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable\nspecialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of\neffective perturbation strategies.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["fine-grained"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-06-15.jsonl"}
