MiniMax-M1 is powered by a hybrid\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture combined with a lightning attention\nmechanism. The model is developed based on our previous MiniMax-Text-01 model,\nwhich contains a total of 456 billion parameters with 45.9 billion parameters\nactivated per token. The M1 model natively supports a context length of 1\nmillion tokens, 8x the context size of DeepSeek R1. Furthermore, the lightning\nattention mechanism in MiniMax-M1 enables efficient scaling of test-time\ncompute. These properties make M1 particularly suitable for complex tasks that\nrequire processing long inputs and thinking extensively. MiniMax-M1 is trained\nusing large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse problems including\nsandbox-based, real-world software engineering environments. In addition to\nM1's inherent efficiency advantage for RL training, we propose CISPO, a novel\nRL algorithm to further enhance RL efficiency. CISPO clips importance sampling\nweights rather than token updates, outperforming other competitive RL variants.\nCombining hybrid-attention and CISPO enables MiniMax-M1's full RL training on\n512 H800 GPUs to complete in only three weeks, with a rental cost of just\n$534,700. We release two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K\nthinking budgets respectively, where the 40K model represents an intermediate\nphase of the 80K training. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our\nmodels are comparable or superior to strong open-weight models such as the\noriginal DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B, with particular strengths in complex\nsoftware engineering, tool utilization, and long-context tasks.

To enhance geometrical and visual fidelity, we introduce a\nunified pipeline that sequentially generates 3D semantic occupancy and the\ncorresponding multiview images, while ensuring alignment between modalities.\nAdditionally, we extend the generated local region into a large-scale scene\nthrough consistency-aware scene outpainting, which extrapolates new occupancy\nand images conditioned on the previously generated area, enhancing spatial\ncontinuity and preserving visual coherence. The resulting scenes are lifted\ninto high-quality 3DGS representations, supporting diverse applications such as\nscene exploration. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that X-Scene\nsignificantly advances controllability and fidelity for large-scale driving\nscene generation, empowering data generation and simulation for autonomous\ndriving.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["consistency"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-06-17.jsonl"}

Existing 3D scene understanding methods use large-scale\ntraining data and CLIP to align text queries with 3D semantic features.\nHowever, their reliance on predefined vocabulary priors from training data\nhinders free-form semantic querying. Besides, recent advanced methods rely on\nLLMs for scene understanding but lack comprehensive 3D scene-level information\nand often overlook the potential inconsistencies in LLM-generated outputs. In\nour paper, we propose FreeQ-Graph, which enables Free-form Querying with a\nsemantic consistent scene Graph for 3D scene understanding. The core idea is to\nencode free-form queries from a complete and accurate 3D scene graph without\npredefined vocabularies, and to align them with 3D consistent semantic labels,\nwhich accomplished through three key steps. We initiate by constructing a\ncomplete and accurate 3D scene graph that maps free-form objects and their\nrelations through LLM and LVLM guidance, entirely free from training data or\npredefined priors. Most importantly, we align graph nodes with accurate\nsemantic labels by leveraging 3D semantic aligned features from merged\nsuperpoints, enhancing 3D semantic consistency. To enable free-form semantic\nquerying, we then design an LLM-based reasoning algorithm that combines\nscene-level and object-level information to intricate reasoning. We conducted\nextensive experiments on 3D semantic grounding, segmentation, and complex\nquerying tasks, while also validating the accuracy of graph generation.\nExperiments on 6 datasets show that our model excels in both complex free-form\nsemantic queries and intricate relational reasoning.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["consistency", "accuracy"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-06-17.jsonl"}

Given a\nfull-shot image (global, low-detail) and one or more close-ups (local,\nhigh-detail), UltraZoom upscales the full image to match the fine detail and\nscale of the close-up examples. To achieve this, we construct a per-instance\npaired dataset from the close-ups and adapt a pretrained generative model to\nlearn object-specific low-to-high resolution mappings. At inference, we apply\nthe model in a sliding window fashion over the full image. Constructing these\npairs is non-trivial: it requires registering the close-ups within the full\nimage for scale estimation and degradation alignment. We introduce a simple,\nrobust method for getting registration on arbitrary materials in casual,\nin-the-wild captures. Together, these components form a system that enables\nseamless pan and zoom across the entire object, producing consistent,\nphotorealistic gigapixel imagery from minimal input.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["dataset"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-06-17.jsonl"}
