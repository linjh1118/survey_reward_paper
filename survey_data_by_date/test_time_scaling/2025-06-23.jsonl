Previous Learngene paradigms fail to handle the generalizable\nknowledge in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we put forward the idea of\nutilizing a multimodal block to extract the multimodal generalizable knowledge,\nwhich inspires us to propose MM-LG (Multimodal Learngene), a novel framework\ndesigned to extract and leverage generalizable components from CLIP.\nSpecifically, we first establish multimodal and unimodal blocks to extract the\nmultimodal and unimodal generalizable knowledge in a weighted-sum manner.\nSubsequently, we employ these components to numerically initialize descendant\nmodels of varying scales and modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nMM-LG's effectiveness, which achieves performance gains over existing learngene\napproaches (e.g.,+3.1% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +4.13% on Flickr30k) and\ncomparable or superior results to the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm\n(e.g.,+1.9% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +3.65% on Flickr30k). Notably, MM-LG\nrequires only around 25% of the parameter storage while reducing around 2.8\ntimes pre-training costs for diverse model scales compared to the pre-training\nand fine-tuning paradigm, making it particularly suitable for efficient\ndeployment across diverse downstream tasks.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-06-23.jsonl"}
