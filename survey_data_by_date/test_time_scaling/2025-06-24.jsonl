However, in\nreal-world settings, AI systems may experience performance degradation over\ntime, due to factors such as shifting data distributions, changes in patient\ncharacteristics, evolving clinical protocols, and variations in data quality.\nThese factors can compromise model reliability, posing safety concerns and\nincreasing the likelihood of inaccurate predictions or adverse outcomes. This\nreview presents a forward-looking perspective on monitoring and maintaining the\n\"health\" of AI systems in healthcare. We highlight the urgent need for\ncontinuous performance monitoring, early degradation detection, and effective\nself-correction mechanisms. The paper begins by reviewing common causes of\nperformance degradation at both data and model levels. We then summarize key\ntechniques for detecting data and model drift, followed by an in-depth look at\nroot cause analysis. Correction strategies are further reviewed, ranging from\nmodel retraining to test-time adaptation. Our survey spans both traditional\nmachine learning models and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs),\noffering insights into their strengths and limitations.

High-resolution soil\nmaps are essential for characterizing permafrost distribution, identifying\nvulnerable areas, and informing adaptation strategies.

While\ngenerative models show promise for data augmentation, current methods mainly\nfocus on enhancing polyp diversity, often overlooking the critical issue of\nfalse positives. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing an adversarial\ndiffusion framework to synthesize high-value false positives. The extensive\nvariability of negative backgrounds presents a significant challenge in false\npositive synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce two key innovations: First,\nwe design a regional noise matching strategy to construct a negative synthesis\nspace using polyp detection datasets. This strategy trains a negative-centric\ndiffusion model by masking polyp regions, ensuring the model focuses\nexclusively on learning diverse background patterns. Second, we introduce the\nDetector-guided Adversarial Diffusion Attacker (DADA) module, which perturbs\nthe negative synthesis process to disrupt a pre-trained detector's decision,\nguiding the negative-centric diffusion model to generate high-value,\ndetector-confusing false positives instead of low-value, ordinary backgrounds.\nOur approach is the first to apply adversarial diffusion to lesion detection,\nestablishing a new paradigm for targeted false positive synthesis and paving\nthe way for more reliable clinical applications in colorectal cancer screening.\nExtensive results on public and in-house datasets verify the superiority of our\nmethod over the current state-of-the-arts, with our synthesized data improving\nthe detectors by at least 2.6% and 2.7% in F1-score, respectively, over the\nbaselines.

By integrating vision and text into a unified space\nwith an expanded vocabulary, our multimodal LLM, Tar, enables cross-modal input\nand output through a shared interface, without the need for modality-specific\ndesigns.

To address diverse decoding needs, we\nutilize two complementary de-tokenizers: a fast autoregressive model and a\ndiffusion-based model. To enhance modality fusion, we investigate advanced\npre-training tasks, demonstrating improvements in both visual understanding and\ngeneration.
