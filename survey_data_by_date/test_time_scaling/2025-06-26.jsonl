The recent generalization to Panoptic Scene\nCompletion (PSC) advances the SSC domain by integrating instance-level\ninformation, thereby enhancing object-level sensitivity in scene understanding.\nWhile PSC was introduced using LiDAR modality, methods based on camera images\nremain largely unexplored. Moreover, recent Transformer-based SSC approaches\nutilize a fixed set of learned queries to reconstruct objects within the scene\nvolume. Although these queries are typically updated with image context during\ntraining, they remain static at test time, limiting their ability to\ndynamically adapt specifically to the observed scene. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose IPFormer, the first approach that leverages\ncontext-adaptive instance proposals at train and test time to address\nvision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion. Specifically, IPFormer adaptively\ninitializes these queries as panoptic instance proposals derived from image\ncontext and further refines them through attention-based encoding and decoding\nto reason about semantic instance-voxel relationships. Experimental results\nshow that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in overall panoptic\nmetrics PQ$^\\dagger$ and PQ-All, matches performance in individual metrics, and\nachieves a runtime reduction exceeding 14$\\times$. Furthermore, our ablation\nstudies reveal that dynamically deriving instance proposals from image context,\nas opposed to random initialization, leads to a 3.62% increase in PQ-All and a\nremarkable average improvement of 18.65% in combined Thing-metrics.

This is largely\ndue to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited\nfamiliarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce\nDeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large\nlanguage model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The\nsystem generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each\naccompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate\nanalytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.\n  DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term\nmemory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific\nanalytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale,\nup-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current\nclinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex\ndiagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We\nevaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional\ndiagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013\ndiseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15\nmethods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other\nagentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing\nthe second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79\npercentage points. For multi-modal input scenarios, DeepRare achieves 70.60% at\nRecall@1 compared to Exomiser's 53.20% in 109 cases.
