However, existing MIL methods often\nfail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both\nglobally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally\nthrough -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a\nprincipled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal\ndistribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel\nMIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv\nformulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two\nconstraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological\ndistributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by\nregulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware\nconstraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by\nprogressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT\nproblem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that\ncan be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.\nEmpirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular\nbenchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In\naddition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers\nhigh interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in\ndigital pathology.

Existing\ntraining-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the\nuse of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during\ngeneration, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes,\nand degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome\nthese challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a\nnovel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text\ngeneration with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC\nstep-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image\nand the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of\ncandidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual\nbaseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually\ngrounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time\ncontext alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring\nthe overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted\nacross diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA,\nInstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces\nhallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference\nefficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an\neffective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations,\nthereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices.

Previous methods achieve satisfactory results for fixed\nviewpoints and small-scale audio variations, but they struggle with large head\nrotations and out-of-distribution (OOD) audio. Moreover, they are constrained\nby the need for time-consuming, identity-specific training. We believe the core\nissue lies in the lack of sufficient 3D priors, which limits the extrapolation\ncapabilities of synthesized talking heads. To address this, we propose\nGGTalker, which synthesizes talking heads through a combination of\ngeneralizable priors and identity-specific adaptation. We introduce a two-stage\nPrior-Adaptation training strategy to learn Gaussian head priors and adapt to\nindividual characteristics. We train Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual\npriors to capture the universal patterns of lip movements and the general\ndistribution of head textures. During the Customized Adaptation, individual\nspeaking styles and texture details are precisely modeled. Additionally, we\nintroduce a color MLP to generate fine-grained, motion-aligned textures and a\nBody Inpainter to blend rendered results with the background, producing\nindistinguishable, photorealistic video frames.
