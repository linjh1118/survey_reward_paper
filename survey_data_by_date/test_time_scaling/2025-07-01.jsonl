To address this, we\ninvestigate ternary language models (TriLMs) that employ quantization-aware\ntraining to significantly reduce memory requirements. We first analyze the\nscalability of TriLMs by conducting a scaling law analysis, revealing that\nTriLMs benefit more from increasing training data than from scaling model\nparameters. Based on this observation, we introduce Spectra-1.1, an open suite\nof TriLMs trained on up to 1.2 trillion tokens, demonstrating sustained\nperformance gains at scale. Furthermore, to improve inference efficiency, we\npropose novel 2-bit and 1.6-bit packing schemes for ternary weights, which\ndemonstrate accelerated inference across various CPU architectures.

In this work, we propose an annealing\nguidance scheduler which dynamically adjusts the guidance scale over time based\non the conditional noisy signal. By learning a scheduling policy, our method\naddresses the temperamental behavior of CFG. Empirical results demonstrate that\nour guidance scheduler significantly enhances image quality and alignment with\nthe text prompt, advancing the performance of text-to-image generation.\nNotably, our novel scheduler requires no additional activations or memory\nconsumption, and can seamlessly replace the common classifier-free guidance,\noffering an improved trade-off between prompt alignment and quality.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-07-01.jsonl"}
