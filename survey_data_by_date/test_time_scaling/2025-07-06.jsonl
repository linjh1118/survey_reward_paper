However, in\nclinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary\nlengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient\nvariability.

In this\nsetting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)\nframework.

Finally, an adaptive\nmulti-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic\nadjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results\non three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the\nproposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion\nnetwork (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively,\nsignificantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical\ndeployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the\nproposed method.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["safety"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-07-06.jsonl"}

However, without\nusing large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt\nto specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding. This problem is caused\nby a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training\ndatasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited\ninformation about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables. In\nthis paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in\nspecialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes. However, we\nidentify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs,\ni.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps.\nTo address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple\nbootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e.,\nbounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more\nfaithful to input images. We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision\ntasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables,\nreceipts, and reports. The results demonstrate that under data-limited regimes\nour approach significantly improves upon fine-tuning and distillation.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-07-06.jsonl"}
