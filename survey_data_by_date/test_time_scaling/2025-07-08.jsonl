In this paper,\nwe introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual\nknowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate\ncomplete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution\nof UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence\ngeneration problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of\nmulti-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the\nconsistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain.\nTo further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a\ndecoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide\ncross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine\ntexture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these\ncomponents allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize\nhigh-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing. Extensive\nexperiments show that SeqTex achieves state-of-the-art performance on both\nimage-conditioned and text-conditioned 3D texture generation tasks, with\nsuperior 3D consistency, texture-geometry alignment, and real-world\ngeneralization.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["consistency"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-07-08.jsonl"}

Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical\ntranscription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the\nbase Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140\nmodified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics\n(ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple\nclinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model\ndemonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI\nbenchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1\nimproved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked\nreduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual\ncorrectness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed\non the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13\nto 4.43 (+41.5%).

To this end,\nwe propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next\nToken Prediction (CNTP).

This study addresses this gap by applying\nstate-of-the-art deep neural network architectures to ground-level habitat\nimagery. Leveraging data from the UK Countryside Survey covering 18 broad\nhabitat types, we evaluate two families of models -- convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) -- under both supervised and\nsupervised contrastive learning paradigms. Our results demonstrate that ViTs\nconsistently outperform state-of-the-art CNN baselines on key classification\nmetrics (Top-3 accuracy = 91\\%, MCC = 0.66) and offer more interpretable scene\nunderstanding tailored to ground-level images. Moreover, supervised contrastive\nlearning significantly reduces misclassification rates among visually similar\nhabitats (e.g., Improved vs. Neutral Grassland), driven by a more\ndiscriminative embedding space. Finally, our best model performs on par with\nexperienced ecological experts in habitat classification from images,\nunderscoring the promise of expert-level automated assessment. By integrating\nadvanced AI with ecological expertise, this research establishes a scalable,\ncost-effective framework for ground-level habitat monitoring to accelerate\nbiodiversity conservation and inform land-use decisions at the national scale.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["accuracy", "fine-grained"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-07-08.jsonl"}

To this end,\nwe propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next\nToken Prediction (CNTP).

To address this challenge, we propose PromptSR, a novel\nprompt-empowered lightweight image SR method.

To address this, most existing methods finetune\nfoundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors.\nHowever, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on\npost-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in\nmodern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error\naccumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface.

However, the uneven global distribution of healthcare\nresources often results in real-world clinical scenarios encountering\nincomplete multimodal data, which significantly compromises diagnostic\naccuracy. Existing commonly used pipelines, such as modality imputation and\ndistillation methods, face notable limitations: 1)Imputation methods struggle\nwith accurately reconstructing key lesion features, since OCT lesions are\nlocalized, while fundus images vary in style. 2)distillation methods rely\nheavily on fully paired multimodal training data. To address these challenges,\nwe propose a novel multimodal alignment and fusion framework capable of\nrobustly handling missing modalities in the task of ophthalmic diagnostics. By\nconsidering the distinctive feature characteristics of OCT and fundus images,\nwe emphasize the alignment of semantic features within the same category and\nexplicitly learn soft matching between modalities, allowing the missing\nmodality to utilize existing modality information, achieving robust cross-modal\nfeature alignment under the missing modality.
