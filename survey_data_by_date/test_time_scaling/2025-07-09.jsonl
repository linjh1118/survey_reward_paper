In this work, we introduce R2-LLMs, a novel and versatile\nhierarchical retrieval-augmented reasoning framework designed to improve\ntest-time scaling in large language models (LLMs) without requiring\ndistillation from more advanced models to obtain chain-of-thought (CoT)\ntraining data. R2-LLMs enhances inference-time generalization by integrating\ndual-level retrieval-based in-context learning: (1) At the coarse level, our\napproach extracts abstract templates from complex reasoning problems and\nretrieves similar problem-answer pairs to facilitate high-level in-context\nlearning; (2) At the fine level, during Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), R2-LLMs\nefficiently retrieves analogous intermediate solution steps from reference\nmathematical problem datasets, refining step-wise reasoning with the aid of a\nprocess reward model (PRM) for scoring. R2-LLMs is a robust hierarchical\nreasoning-augmentation method that enhances in-context-level reasoning while\nseamlessly integrating with step-level tree search methods.

After each\naction, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step.\nHowever, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning\n(i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is\nnon-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in\ncomplex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual\ntargets.\n  This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI\nTest-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate\naction proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we\nsample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to\nevaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better\ndecision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and\nimproving overall performance.

In this\npaper, we propose Multi-turn Grounding-based Policy Optimization (MGPO), an\nend-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables LMMs to\niteratively focus on key visual regions by automatically cropping sub-images,\nbased on model-predicted grounding coordinates within a multi-turn conversation\nframework. Compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which requires costly\nadditional grounding annotations, our approach highlights that LMMs can emerge\nrobust grounding abilities during the RL training process, leveraging only a\nbinary reward function derived from the correctness of the final answer.\nAdditionally, we observe that LMMs struggle to autonomously trigger visual\ngrounding during the rollout process. To address this cold start problem, we\ndesign a multi-turn conversational template and restrict policy loss\ncomputation to model outputs generated across multiple dialogue rounds, thereby\npromoting stable optimization.

While\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have excelled in structured data like\nimages, extending them to irregular 3D meshes is challenging due to the\nnon-Euclidean nature of the data. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) offer a\nsolution by applying convolutions to graph-structured data, but many existing\nmethods rely on isotropic filters or spectral decomposition, limiting their\nability to capture both local and global mesh features. In this paper, we\nintroduce 3D Geometric Mesh Network (3DGeoMeshNet), a novel GCN-based framework\nthat uses anisotropic convolution layers to effectively learn both global and\nlocal features directly in the spatial domain. Unlike previous approaches that\nconvert meshes into intermediate representations like voxel grids or point\nclouds, our method preserves the original polygonal mesh format throughout the\nreconstruction process, enabling more accurate shape reconstruction. Our\narchitecture features a multi-scale encoder-decoder structure, where separate\nglobal and local pathways capture both large-scale geometric structures and\nfine-grained local details. Extensive experiments on the COMA dataset\ncontaining human faces demonstrate the efficiency of 3DGeoMeshNet in terms of\nreconstruction accuracy.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["dataset", "accuracy", "fine-grained"], "score": 3}}, "source_file": "2025-07-09.jsonl"}
