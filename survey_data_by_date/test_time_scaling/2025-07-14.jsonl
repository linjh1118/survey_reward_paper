However, existing deep learning-based methods face two\nmajor challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,\nwhich limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity\nhierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in\npractice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused\nby sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU\nmodels to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop\nclassification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of\nLCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose\nHieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables\nmulti-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU\nmodels to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies.
