For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road,\n3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect\nanomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the\ngeneralization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes\nand to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D\ndetection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the\ninsufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This\npaper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm,\nwhich decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the\ngeneralization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an\nanomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving\ntarget-level anomaly scoring.

Our method uses an iterative\nin-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced,\nboundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise\nadjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score,\neffectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully\nsynthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label\nfeatures derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between\nnear-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark,\nwith minimal increases in parameters and runtime.

In this work, we introduce FaceLLM, a multimodal\nlarge language model trained specifically for facial image understanding. To\nconstruct the training data, we propose a novel weakly supervised pipeline that\nuses ChatGPT with attribute-aware prompts to generate high-quality\nquestion-answer pairs based on images from the FairFace dataset.

To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1\nSAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired with structured textual\nannotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from\nauthoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific\nsources.

Our experiments show that CLOSP achieves\na new state-of-the-art, improving retrieval nDGC by 54% over existing models.\nAdditionally, we find that the unified training strategy overcomes the inherent\ndifficulty of interpreting SAR imagery by transferring rich semantic knowledge\nfrom the optical domain with indirect interaction. Furthermore, GeoCLOSP, which\nintegrates geographic coordinates into our framework, creates a powerful\ntrade-off between generality and specificity: while the CLOSP excels at general\nsemantic tasks, the GeoCLOSP becomes a specialized expert for retrieving\nlocation-dependent crisis events and rare geographic features.
