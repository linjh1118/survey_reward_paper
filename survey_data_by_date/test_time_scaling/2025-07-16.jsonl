While some approaches introduce\nfrequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches\nlimits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the\nDark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel\ndual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment\nacross spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two\nkey modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a\npixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance\nhaze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware\nspectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which\nfuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid\ngating mechanisms to recover fine structural details.

To\naddress this semantic ambiguity, we propose HanjaBridge, a novel\nmeaning-injection technique integrated into a continual pre-training (CPT)\nframework. Instead of deterministically mapping a word to a single Hanja\n(Chinese character), HanjaBridge presents the model with all possible Hanja\ncandidates for a given homograph, encouraging the model to learn contextual\ndisambiguation. This process is paired with token-level knowledge distillation\nto prevent catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that HanjaBridge\nsignificantly improves Korean language understanding, achieving a 21\\% relative\nimprovement on the KoBALT benchmark.
