Motivated by advances in self-supervised learning\nand in-context generative modeling, we propose a series of simple yet powerful\ndesign choices that significantly enhance diffusion model capacity for\nstructured, controllable generation and editing. We introduce Masking-Augmented\nDiffusion with Inference-Time Scaling (MADI), a framework that improves the\neditability, compositionality and controllability of diffusion models through\ntwo core innovations. First, we introduce Masking-Augmented gaussian Diffusion\n(MAgD), a novel training strategy with dual corruption process which combines\nstandard denoising score matching and masked reconstruction by masking noisy\ninput from forward process. MAgD encourages the model to learn discriminative\nand compositional visual representations, thus enabling localized and\nstructure-aware editing. Second, we introduce an inference-time capacity\nscaling mechanism based on Pause Tokens, which act as special placeholders\ninserted into the prompt for increasing computational capacity at inference\ntime. Our findings show that adopting expressive and dense prompts during\ntraining further enhances performance, particularly for MAgD.

Additionally, existing methods assume\nthat camera parameters are available, limiting their applicability in scenarios\nlike crowdsourced high-definition (HD) lane mapping. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Depth3DLane, a novel dual-pathway framework that\nintegrates self-supervised monocular depth estimation to provide explicit\nstructural information, without the need for expensive sensors or additional\nground-truth depth data. Leveraging a self-supervised depth network to obtain a\npoint cloud representation of the scene, our bird's-eye view pathway extracts\nexplicit spatial information, while our front view pathway simultaneously\nextracts rich semantic information. Depth3DLane then uses 3D lane anchors to\nsample features from both pathways and infer accurate 3D lane geometry.\nFurthermore, we extend the framework to predict camera parameters on a\nper-frame basis and introduce a theoretically motivated fitting procedure to\nenhance stability on a per-segment basis. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat Depth3DLane achieves competitive performance on the OpenLane benchmark\ndataset.
