However, adopting AI models in risk-sensitive\ndomains often requires error rates near 0%. To address this gap, we propose\ncollaboration between a reasoning model and a human expert who resolves queries\nthe model cannot confidently answer. We find that quantifying the uncertainty\nof a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an\neffective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3\n235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring\n7.5% of queries. However, the high latency of reasoning models still makes them\nchallenging to deploy on use cases with high query volume. To address this\nchallenge, we explore fronting a reasoning model with a large non-reasoning\nmodel. We call this modified human-in-the-loop system \"Fail Fast, or Ask\",\nsince the non-reasoning model may defer difficult queries to the human expert\ndirectly (\"failing fast\"), without incurring the reasoning model's higher\nlatency.

We present an approach for pose estimation in cryo-EM that\nleverages multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques in a robust manner to\nestimate the 3D rotation matrix of each particle from pairs of dihedral angles.\nWe express the rotation matrix in the form of an axis of rotation and a unit\nvector in the plane perpendicular to the axis. The technique leverages the\nconcept of common lines in 3D reconstruction from projections. However, common\nline estimation is ridden with large errors due to the very low SNR of cryo-EM\nprojection images. To address this challenge, we introduce two complementary\ncomponents: (i) a robust joint optimization framework for pose estimation based\non an $\\ell_1$-norm objective or a similar robust norm, which simultaneously\nestimates rotation axes and in-plane vectors while exactly enforcing unit norm\nand orthogonality constraints via projected coordinate descent; and (ii) an\niterative shift correction algorithm that estimates consistent in-plane\ntranslations through a global least-squares formulation. While prior approaches\nhave leveraged such embeddings and common-line geometry for orientation\nrecovery, existing formulations typically rely on $\\ell_2$-based objectives\nthat are sensitive to noise, and enforce geometric constraints only\napproximately. These choices, combined with a sequential pipeline structure,\ncan lead to compounding errors and suboptimal reconstructions in low-SNR\nregimes.

Moreover, when rendering\nlarge-scale scenes, compressing and streaming probe data is more efficient than\nusing explicit scene geometry. Therefore, our neural representation approach\ncan potentially be applied to virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)\napplications.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-07-22.jsonl"}

To address\nthese shortcomings, this paper proposes InsightX Agent, a novel LMM-based\nagentic framework designed to deliver reliable, interpretable, and interactive\nX-ray NDT analysis. Unlike typical sequential pipelines, InsightX Agent\npositions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator,\ncoordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the\nEvidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect\nregion proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through\nNon-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in\nX-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides\nthe LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating\ncontext assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination,\nconfidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the\nSDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using\ntools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning,\nenhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate\ndiverse information sources. Experimental evaluations on the GDXray+ dataset\ndemonstrate that InsightX Agent not only achieves a high object detection\nF1-score of 96.35% but also offers significantly improved interpretability and\ntrustworthiness in its analyses, highlighting the transformative potential of\nagentic LLM frameworks for industrial inspection tasks.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["dataset", "reliability"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-07-22.jsonl"}

Project Page:\n  https://tau-vailab.github.io/BlendedPC/", "summary": "Natural language offers a highly intuitive interface for enabling localized\nfine-grained edits of 3D shapes. However, prior works face challenges in\npreserving global coherence while locally modifying the input 3D shape. In this\nwork, we introduce an inpainting-based framework for editing shapes represented\nas point clouds. Our approach leverages foundation 3D diffusion models for\nachieving localized shape edits, adding structural guidance in the form of a\npartial conditional shape, ensuring that other regions correctly preserve the\nshape's identity. Furthermore, to encourage identity preservation also within\nthe local edited region, we propose an inference-time coordinate blending\nalgorithm which balances reconstruction of the full shape with inpainting at a\nprogression of noise levels during the inference process. Our coordinate\nblending algorithm seamlessly blends the original shape with its edited\nversion, enabling a fine-grained editing of 3D shapes, all while circumventing\nthe need for computationally expensive and often inaccurate inversion.\nExtensive experiments show that our method outperforms alternative techniques\nacross a wide range of metrics that evaluate both fidelity to the original\nshape and also adherence to the textual description.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["inference-time"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["fine-grained"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-07-22.jsonl"}
