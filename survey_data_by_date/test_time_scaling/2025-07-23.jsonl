More importantly, we reveal and critically\nexamine an implicit assumption in prior work: intermediate reasoning steps are\nhidden from adversaries. By relaxing this assumption, we identify an important\nsecurity risk, intuitively motivated and empirically verified as an inverse\nscaling law: if intermediate reasoning steps become explicitly accessible,\nincreased inference-time computation consistently reduces model robustness.\nFinally, we discuss practical scenarios where models with hidden reasoning\nchains are still vulnerable to attacks, such as models with tool-integrated\nreasoning and advanced reasoning extraction attacks. Our findings collectively\ndemonstrate that the robustness benefits of inference-time scaling depend\nheavily on the adversarial setting and deployment context.

As complex\nsystems grow, coherence becomes fragile unless a higher-order structure ensures\nsemantic consistency. This paper introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle\n(RCP): a foundational constraint stating that for any reasoning system of order\nN, composed of systems operating over conceptual spaces of order N-1, semantic\ncoherence is preserved only by a recursively evaluable generalization operator\nthat spans and aligns those lower-order conceptual spaces. Crucially, this\ncoherence enables structural alignment. Without recursive coherence, no system\ncan reliably preserve goals, meanings, or reasoning consistency at scale. We\nformally define the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as the only known\noperator capable of satisfying the RCP at any scale. The FMI is a minimal,\ncomposable architecture with internal functions (evaluation, modeling,\nadaptation, stability, decomposition, bridging) and external functions\n(storage, recall, System 1 and System 2 reasoning) vital for preserving\nsemantic structure across inference and coordination layers. We prove that any\nsystem lacking the FMI will experience recursive coherence breakdown as it\nscales, arguing that common AI issues like misalignment, hallucination, and\ninstability are symptoms of this structural coherence loss. Unlike other\nfoundational principles, RCP uniquely captures the internal, recursive dynamics\nneeded for coherent, alignable intelligence, modeling semantic coherence under\nrecursion.
