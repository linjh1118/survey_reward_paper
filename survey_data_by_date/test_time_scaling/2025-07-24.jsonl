However, this decoupling creates a critical challenge:\npredicting the model capacity of a given MoE configurations (e.g., expert\nactivation ratio and granularity) remains an unresolved problem. To address\nthis gap, we introduce Efficiency Leverage (EL), a metric quantifying the\ncomputational advantage of an MoE model over a dense equivalent. We conduct a\nlarge-scale empirical study, training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, to\nsystematically investigate the relationship between MoE architectural\nconfigurations and EL. Our findings reveal that EL is primarily driven by the\nexpert activation ratio and the total compute budget, both following\npredictable power laws, while expert granularity acts as a non-linear modulator\nwith a clear optimal range. We integrate these discoveries into a unified\nscaling law that accurately predicts the EL of an MoE architecture based on its\nconfiguration. To validate our derived scaling laws, we designed and trained\nLing-mini-beta, a pilot model for Ling-2.0 series with only 0.85B active\nparameters, alongside a 6.1B dense model for comparison. When trained on an\nidentical 1T high-quality token dataset, Ling-mini-beta matched the performance\nof the 6.1B dense model while consuming over 7x fewer computational resources,\nthereby confirming the accuracy of our scaling laws.

Compared to\ntraditional explicit representations, such as TSDF, it improves the mapping\ncompleteness and memory efficiency. However, the lack of reconstruction details\nand the time-consuming learning of neural representations hinder the widespread\napplication of neural-based methods to large-scale online reconstruction. We\nintroduce RemixFusion, a novel residual-based mixed representation for scene\nreconstruction and camera pose estimation dedicated to high-quality and\nlarge-scale online RGB-D reconstruction. In particular, we propose a\nresidual-based map representation comprised of an explicit coarse TSDF grid and\nan implicit neural module that produces residuals representing fine-grained\ndetails to be added to the coarse grid. Such mixed representation allows for\ndetail-rich reconstruction with bounded time and memory budget, contrasting\nwith the overly-smoothed results by the purely implicit representations, thus\npaving the way for high-quality camera tracking. Furthermore, we extend the\nresidual-based representation to handle multi-frame joint pose optimization via\nbundle adjustment (BA). In contrast to the existing methods, which optimize\nposes directly, we opt to optimize pose changes. Combined with a novel\ntechnique for adaptive gradient amplification, our method attains better\noptimization convergence and global optimality. Furthermore, we adopt a local\nmoving volume to factorize the mixed scene representation with a\ndivide-and-conquer design to facilitate efficient online learning in our\nresidual-based framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\nsurpasses all state-of-the-art ones, including those based either on explicit\nor implicit representations, in terms of the accuracy of both mapping and\ntracking on large-scale scenes.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["accuracy", "fine-grained"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-07-24.jsonl"}

In this work,\nwe introduce CNS-Bench, a Continuous Nuisance Shift Benchmark to quantify OOD\nrobustness of image classifiers for continuous and realistic generative\nnuisance shifts. CNS-Bench allows generating a wide range of individual\nnuisance shifts in continuous severities by applying LoRA adapters to diffusion\nmodels. To address failure cases, we propose a filtering mechanism that\noutperforms previous methods, thereby enabling reliable benchmarking with\ngenerative models. With the proposed benchmark, we perform a large-scale study\nto evaluate the robustness of more than 40 classifiers under various nuisance\nshifts. Through carefully designed comparisons and analyses, we find that model\nrankings can change for varying shifts and shift scales, which cannot be\ncaptured when applying common binary shifts.
