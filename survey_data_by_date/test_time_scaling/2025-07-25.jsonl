In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the\nfirst general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR)\nmodels, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To\ndynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we\nfirst introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the\ncausal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical\ncoarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key\ncomponents: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for\nevaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or\nrejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain\nsufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity\nsearch. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering,\nenabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales,\nresampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using\npotential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating\nmulti-scale generation history.

In addition, we propose the Inner Layer Hybrid\nStrategy, which combines attention and Mamba at a finer granularity, enabling\nsimultaneous capture of long-range dependencies and fine-grained local\nfeatures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and\ngeneralization of our HybridTM on diverse indoor and outdoor datasets.\nFurthermore, our HybridTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet,\nScanNet200, and nuScenes benchmarks.

While the personalization of dynamic\nconcepts, which capture subject-specific appearance and motion from a single\nvideo, is now feasible, most existing methods require per-instance fine-tuning,\nlimiting scalability. We introduce a fully zero-shot framework for dynamic\nconcept personalization in text-to-video models. Our method leverages\nstructured 2x2 video grids that spatially organize input and output pairs,\nenabling the training of lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing and\ncomposition within these grids. At inference, a dedicated Grid Fill module\ncompletes partially observed layouts, producing temporally coherent and\nidentity preserving outputs. Once trained, the entire system operates in a\nsingle forward pass, generalizing to previously unseen dynamic concepts without\nany test-time optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate high-quality and\nconsistent results across a wide range of subjects beyond trained concepts and\nediting scenarios.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["test-time"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-07-25.jsonl"}
