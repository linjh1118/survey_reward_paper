Soft injection is performed by\nsoftly mixing task embeddings with attention head activations using\npre-optimized mixing parameters, referred to as soft head-selection parameters.\nThis method not only allows a desired task to be performed without in-prompt\ndemonstrations but also significantly outperforms existing ICL approaches while\nreducing memory usage and compute cost at inference time. An extensive\nevaluation is performed across 57 tasks and 12 LLMs, spanning four model\nfamilies of sizes from 4B to 70B. Averaged across 57 tasks, our method\noutperforms 10-shot ICL by 10.1%-13.9% across 12 LLMs. Additional analyses show\nthat our method also serves as an insightful tool for analyzing task-relevant\nroles of attention heads, revealing that task-relevant head positions selected\nby our method transfer across similar tasks but not across dissimilar ones --\nunderscoring the task-specific nature of head functionality.

In contrast, natural language provides a more flexible,\nexpressive, and interpretable way to represent emotions, offering a much\nbroader source of supervision. Yet, leveraging semantically rich natural\nlanguage captions as supervisory signals for facial emotion representation\nlearning remains relatively underexplored, primarily due to two key challenges:\n1) the lack of large-scale caption datasets with rich emotional semantics, and\n2) the absence of effective frameworks tailored to harness such rich\nsupervision. To this end, we introduce EmoCap100K, a large-scale facial emotion\ncaption dataset comprising over 100,000 samples, featuring rich and structured\nsemantic descriptions that capture both global affective states and\nfine-grained local facial behaviors. Building upon this dataset, we further\npropose EmoCapCLIP, which incorporates a joint global-local contrastive\nlearning framework enhanced by a cross-modal guided positive mining module.\nThis design facilitates the comprehensive exploitation of multi-level caption\ninformation while accommodating semantic similarities between closely related\nexpressions. Extensive evaluations on over 20 benchmarks covering five tasks\ndemonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting the promise of\nlearning facial emotion representations from large-scale semantically rich\ncaptions.

However, the\nproprietary nature of these models and their training data creates a\nsignificant barrier for open-source research. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nGPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M, a publicly available, large-scale image-editing corpus\ncontaining more than 1.5 million high-quality triplets (instruction, source\nimage, edited image). We systematically construct this dataset by leveraging\nthe versatile capabilities of GPT-4o to unify and refine three popular\nimage-editing datasets: OmniEdit, HQ-Edit, and UltraEdit. Specifically, our\nmethodology involves 1) regenerating output images to enhance visual quality\nand instruction alignment, and 2) selectively rewriting prompts to improve\nsemantic clarity. To validate the efficacy of our dataset, we fine-tune\nadvanced open-source models on GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M. The empirical results are\nexciting, e.g., the fine-tuned FluxKontext achieves highly competitive\nperformance across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, including 7.24 on\nGEdit-EN, 3.80 on ImgEdit-Full, and 8.78 on Complex-Edit, showing stronger\ninstruction following and higher perceptual quality while maintaining identity.\nThese scores markedly exceed all previously published open-source methods and\nsubstantially narrow the gap to leading proprietary models.

Therefore, can we\ndraw inspiration from 3D in-the-wild reconstruction techniques and use\nunconstrained photo collections to create an immersive approach for\nunderstanding the 3D structure of architectural components? To this end, we\nextend language embedded 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and propose a novel\nframework for open-vocabulary scene understanding from unconstrained photo\ncollections. Specifically, we first render multiple appearance images from the\nsame viewpoint as the unconstrained image with the reconstructed radiance\nfield, then extract multi-appearance CLIP features and two types of language\nfeature uncertainty maps-transient and appearance uncertainty-derived from the\nmulti-appearance features to guide the subsequent optimization process. Next,\nwe propose a transient uncertainty-aware autoencoder, a multi-appearance\nlanguage field 3DGS representation, and a post-ensemble strategy to effectively\ncompress, learn, and fuse language features from multiple appearances. Finally,\nto quantitatively evaluate our method, we introduce PT-OVS, a new benchmark\ndataset for assessing open-vocabulary segmentation performance on unconstrained\nphoto collections.
