However,\ncurrent 3D design tools struggle to replicate this natural process, requiring\nconsiderable artistic expertise and manual labor. This paper introduces BANG, a\nnovel generative approach that bridges 3D generation and reasoning, allowing\nfor intuitive and flexible part-level decomposition of 3D objects. At the heart\nof BANG is \"Generative Exploded Dynamics\", which creates a smooth sequence of\nexploded states for an input geometry, progressively separating parts while\npreserving their geometric and semantic coherence.\n  BANG utilizes a pre-trained large-scale latent diffusion model, fine-tuned\nfor exploded dynamics with a lightweight exploded view adapter, allowing\nprecise control over the decomposition process. It also incorporates a temporal\nattention module to ensure smooth transitions and consistency across time. BANG\nenhances control with spatial prompts, such as bounding boxes and surface\nregions, enabling users to specify which parts to decompose and how. This\ninteraction can be extended with multimodal models like GPT-4, enabling\n2D-to-3D manipulations for more intuitive and creative workflows.\n  The capabilities of BANG extend to generating detailed part-level geometry,\nassociating parts with functional descriptions, and facilitating\ncomponent-aware 3D creation and manufacturing workflows. Additionally, BANG\noffers applications in 3D printing, where separable parts are generated for\neasy printing and reassembly.

Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on five mainstream\nVLMs to assess their reliability in safety-sensitive driving tasks.\nExperimental results demonstrate that integrating RAG significantly improves\nperformance, achieving a +4.73% gain in Traffic Accidents tasks, +8.79% in\nCorner Cases tasks and +14.57% in Traffic Safety Commonsense across five\nmainstream VLMs, underscoring the potential of our proposed benchmark and\nmethodology for advancing research in traffic safety.
