Synthetic\ndata methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering\nreal-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability\nto be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data\ngeneration in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and\nAnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal\nObject Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and\ncontrollable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated\nsimultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI\nenables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a\nspecified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic\nconsistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods\nthat rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning\nto ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling.

However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of\ndistributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead\ndramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust\nevaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations\ncan reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting\ncollaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an\nautonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic\nchain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish\nand maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in\nautonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose\nagentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations\nof collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle\nperiods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In\naddition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator\nresources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task\nrequirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust\nsemantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of\ncollaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on\ntrust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust\naccuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be\nchained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient\ncoordination in large-scale systems.

Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be\nproactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose\na novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent\nto transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed\nstrategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key\nchallenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse\nforgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics?

To address the challenges,\nwe propose a Recall Router framework.

This work analyzes the influence of\nhyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven\nefficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT\nv2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are\ntrained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an\nemphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is\nundertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including\nlearning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation,\nregularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for\nreal-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and\nTop-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter\ncount, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge\ndeployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and\nadjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,\nwhile keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80%\nTop-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling\nbalance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results\ngive practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning\nmodels appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines.

In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity\nfield modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed\nFlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering\n(VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a\nflow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and\nsize of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on\nmulti-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple\nreal-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not\nonly notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry\nartifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian\ntrajectories.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-08-01.jsonl"}

To address this limitation, we build a large-scale\ngrasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like\ninstructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k\nreasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as\nwild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully\nannotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions\nis largely increased by removing their category name and only providing\nfunctional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive\naffordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a\nVLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that\nconditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on\naffordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that\nour model has a powerful open-world generalization ability.

To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D\nGaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale\nbenchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance\nunderstanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an\nend-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D\naffordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that\nautoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens,\nguiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle\ncomplex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional\nGeometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete\naffordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a\nrobust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design\na feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision\nFoundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art\non our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from\nsingle-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["benchmark"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-08-01.jsonl"}
