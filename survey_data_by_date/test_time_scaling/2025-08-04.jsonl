These\nshortcomings limit the applicability to control diffusion models that require\nintense computation, such as Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models.

Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in\nhandling complex tasks with limited data availability.

Existing approaches\nprimarily focus on local feature enhancement or incorporate complex attention\nmechanisms to highlight small objects, often at the cost of increased model\ncomplexity and reduced efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose an\nefficient path aggregation network (EPANet), which leverages complementary\nfeature integration to achieve accurate and lightweight UFD. EPANet consists of\ntwo key components: an efficient path aggregation feature pyramid network\n(EPA-FPN) and a multi-scale diverse-division short path bottleneck (MS-DDSP\nbottleneck). The EPA-FPN introduces long-range skip connections across\ndisparate scales to improve semantic-spatial complementarity, while cross-layer\nfusion paths are adopted to enhance feature integration efficiency. The MS-DDSP\nbottleneck extends the conventional bottleneck structure by introducing\nfiner-grained feature division and diverse convolutional operations, thereby\nincreasing local feature diversity and representation capacity. Extensive\nexperiments on benchmark UFD datasets demonstrate that EPANet outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and inference speed,\nwhile maintaining comparable or even lower parameter complexity.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["benchmark", "accuracy"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-08-04.jsonl"}

However, in complex real-world scenes, characterized by\nextreme viewpoint and scale changes as well as pronounced depth\ndiscontinuities, the motion field often exhibits diverse and heterogeneous\nmotion patterns. Most existing methods lack targeted modeling strategies and\nfail to explicitly account for this variability, resulting in estimated motion\nfields that diverge from their true underlying structure and distribution. We\nobserve that Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can assign dedicated experts to motion\nsub-fields, enabling a divide-and-conquer strategy for heterogeneous motion\npatterns. Building on this insight, we re-architect motion field modeling in\ntwo-view geometry with GeoMoE, a streamlined framework. Specifically, we first\ndevise a Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition strategy that exploits inlier\nprobability signals to perform a structure-aware decomposition of the motion\nfield into heterogeneous sub-fields, sharply curbing outlier-induced bias.\nNext, we introduce an MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier that enhances each\nsub-field along spatial-context and channel-semantic paths and routes it to a\ncustomized expert for targeted modeling, thereby decoupling heterogeneous\nmotion regimes, suppressing cross-sub-field interference and representational\nentanglement, and yielding fine-grained motion-field rectification.
