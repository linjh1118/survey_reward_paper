Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy\ncriterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class\ncompactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution\nshifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class\ndistributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between\ncache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this\nobservation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time\nAdaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing\nprototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for\nintegrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class\ndistributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using\nhigh-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating\ncross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype\nresidual fine-tuning.

We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe\ncompletions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central\nto our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic\ninconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved\ntraining documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary\ninterventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses\ncompletions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a\ncontrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO,\nand (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam\nexpansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans.

This limitation has led to efforts to generate images\nconditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work\nmodifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated\nimages by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.\nThis enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,\ngenerally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two\ncommon issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate\nimages that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches\nneglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.\nSpecifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired\nconditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve\nthis, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired\nconditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image\nprompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention\nmodifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image\nand alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and\nvalues from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the\ngenerated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new\nself-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys\nand values from both images rather than selecting between them.

In this paper, we propose\nSplatSSC, a novel framework that resolves these limitations with a depth-guided\ninitialization strategy and a principled Gaussian aggregator. Instead of random\ninitialization, SplatSSC utilizes a dedicated depth branch composed of a\nGroup-wise Multi-scale Fusion (GMF) module, which integrates multi-scale image\nand depth features to generate a sparse yet representative set of initial\nGaussian primitives. To mitigate noise from outlier primitives, we develop the\nDecoupled Gaussian Aggregator (DGA), which enhances robustness by decomposing\ngeometric and semantic predictions during the Gaussian-to-voxel splatting\nprocess.

However, through an\nin-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a\npreviously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information\nbut also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality\nbias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both\nvisual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of\nuser-provided instructions.
