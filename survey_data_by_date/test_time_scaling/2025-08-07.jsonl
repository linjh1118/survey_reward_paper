This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing\nthe epistemological challenge of \"creation without understanding\" that\ncharacterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's\nreliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic\ncomputational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot\nbe analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of\nscaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,\nI demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly\nsensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My\ninvestigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss\nthresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of\nemergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent\nproperties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where\nsystemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple\ncomponents without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper\nconcludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a\nnew domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of\nemergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology.

This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of\ntraining data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which\nconsists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs\nwith certain objects masked.
