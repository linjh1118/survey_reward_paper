To overcome these\nlimitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework\ndesigned for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary\nsub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination\nAdaptor (FIA).

This task is realized by representing the\nimage as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a\ndeep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.\nDespite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly\nill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive\ntextures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the\nlow-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in\ntheir high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the\nASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this\nenhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original\norientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the\ninput image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation\nequivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign\nthe basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic\nrotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.\nThrough such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be\nimplemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to\noutput. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic\nequivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an\nequivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated\nby experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets. We also validate\nthat the proposed framework can be readily integrated into current ASISR\nmethods in a plug \\& play manner to further enhance their performance.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-08-08.jsonl"}

To address\nthis, we propose \\textbf{X-MoGen}, the first unified framework for\ncross-species text-driven motion generation covering both humans and animals.\nX-MoGen adopts a two-stage architecture.

Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing\nmodel representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model\nuser sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to\nstudy persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage\ninsights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of\npersuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.\nDespite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of\npersuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can\nidentify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where\npersuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show\nthat in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,\nprobes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such\nas when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible\navenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and\nmanipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset\nanalysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["dataset"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-08-08.jsonl"}
