In this paper, we introduce LET-US,\na framework for long event-stream--text comprehension that employs an adaptive\ncompression mechanism to reduce the volume of input events while preserving\ncritical visual details. LET-US thus establishes a new frontier in cross-modal\ninferential understanding over extended event sequences. To bridge the\nsubstantial modality gap between event streams and textual representations, we\nadopt a two-stage optimization paradigm that progressively equips our model\nwith the capacity to interpret event-based scenes. To handle the voluminous\ntemporal information inherent in long event streams, we leverage text-guided\ncross-modal queries for feature reduction, augmented by hierarchical clustering\nand similarity computation to distill the most representative event features.\nMoreover, we curate and construct a large-scale event-text aligned dataset to\ntrain our model, achieving tighter alignment of event features within the LLM\nembedding space. We also develop a comprehensive benchmark covering a diverse\nset of tasks -- reasoning, captioning, classification, temporal localization\nand moment retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that LET-US outperforms\nprior state-of-the-art MLLMs in both descriptive accuracy and semantic\ncomprehension on long-duration event streams.

Manual inspection is inefficient and error-prone, while\ntraditional vision algorithms struggle with densely packed plates, low\ncontrast, scale variation, and imaging artifacts.

While recent progress has been driven by large-scale pre-training\nand data augmentation, current methods still struggle to generalize to unseen\nscenarios, particularly when complex spatial and temporal reasoning is\nrequired. In this work, we propose SkillNav, a modular framework that\nintroduces structured, skill-based reasoning into Transformer-based VLN agents.\nOur method decomposes navigation into a set of interpretable atomic skills\n(e.g., Vertical Movement, Area and Region Identification, Stop and Pause), each\nhandled by a specialized agent. We then introduce a novel zero-shot\nVision-Language Model (VLM)-based router, which dynamically selects the most\nsuitable agent at each time step by aligning sub-goals with visual observations\nand historical actions.

We introduce FEAT (ForEnsic\nAgenT), a multi-agent AI framework that automates and standardizes death\ninvestigations through a domain-adapted large language model. FEAT's\napplication-oriented architecture integrates: (i) a central Planner for task\ndecomposition, (ii) specialized Local Solvers for evidence analysis, (iii) a\nMemory & Reflection module for iterative refinement, and (iv) a Global Solver\nfor conclusion synthesis. The system employs tool-augmented reasoning,\nhierarchical retrieval-augmented generation, forensic-tuned LLMs, and\nhuman-in-the-loop feedback to ensure legal and medical validity. In evaluations\nacross diverse Chinese case cohorts, FEAT outperformed state-of-the-art AI\nsystems in both long-form autopsy analyses and concise cause-of-death\nconclusions. It demonstrated robust generalization across six geographic\nregions and achieved high expert concordance in blinded validations. Senior\npathologists validated FEAT's outputs as comparable to those of human experts,\nwith improved detection of subtle evidentiary nuances. To our knowledge, FEAT\nis the first LLM-based AI agent system dedicated to forensic medicine, offering\nscalable, consistent death certification while maintaining expert-level rigor.\nBy integrating AI efficiency with human oversight, this work could advance\nequitable access to reliable medicolegal services while addressing critical\ncapacity constraints in forensic systems.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["iterative refinement"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-08-12.jsonl"}
