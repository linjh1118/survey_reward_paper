These transformations allow us to measure the\nsensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more\naccurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this\nnew evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with\nmultiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math\nproblems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative\nLLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models\nwe observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship\nreasoning model, O3, scores 49 % on the originals but drops by 4 percentage\npoints on surface variants, and by 10.5 percentage points on core-step-based\nvariants, while smaller models fare far worse.

By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed\nthat some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic\nparallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel\ndecoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In\nthis paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which\naddresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data\nand efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a\nnon-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable\nstructures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient\nadaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which\nenables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while\nmaintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive\nevaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical\nReasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both\neffectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up\nto 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within\n1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant\nacceleration without compromising generation quality.

To address this\nissue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal\nconsistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time\ndecoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select\nthe most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal\nConsistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a\nmeasure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward\nsignal to encourage stable generations.
