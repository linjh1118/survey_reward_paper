A key real-world challenge arises when a model\nperforms poorly on unknown samples, yet these samples remain available for\nanalysis. This highlights that it should be approached as a ``few-shot\" task,\nwhere effectively utilizing a small number of samples can lead to significant\nimprovement. Unlike typical few-shot tasks focused on semantic understanding,\ndeepfake detection prioritizes image realism, which closely mirrors real-world\ndistributions. In this work, we propose the Few-shot Training-free Network\n(FTNet) for real-world few-shot deepfake detection. Simple yet effective, FTNet\ndiffers from traditional methods that rely on large-scale known data for\ntraining. Instead, FTNet uses only one fake samplefrom an evaluation set,\nmimicking the scenario where new samples emerge in the real world and can be\ngathered for use, without any training or parameter updates. During evaluation,\neach test sample is compared to the known fake and real samples, and it is\nclassified based on the category of the nearest sample. We conduct a\ncomprehensive analysis of AI-generated images from 29 different generative\nmodels and achieve a new SoTA performance, with an average improvement of 8.7\\%\ncompared to existing methods.

Initially, a noise estimation module is employed to adaptively\nassess the noise levels present in transient data. Subsequently, a\nparameterized neural operator is developed to approximate the inverse mapping,\nfacilitating end-to-end rapid image reconstruction. Our 3D image reconstruction\nframework, grounded in operator learning, is constructed through deep algorithm\nunfolding, which not only provides commendable model interpretability but also\nenables dynamic adaptation to varying noise levels in the acquired data,\nthereby ensuring consistently robust and accurate reconstruction outcomes.\nFurthermore, we introduce a novel method for the fusion of global and local\nspatiotemporal data features. By integrating structural and detailed\ninformation, this method significantly enhances both accuracy and robustness.\nComprehensive numerical experiments conducted on both simulated and real\ndatasets substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method.
