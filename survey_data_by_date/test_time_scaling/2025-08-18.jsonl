However, in extreme degradation scenarios\n(e.g., scale $> 8\\times$), critical attributes and ID information are often\nseverely lost in the input image, making it difficult for conventional models\nto reconstruct realistic and ID-consistent faces. Existing methods tend to\ngenerate hallucinated faces under such conditions, producing restored images\nlacking authentic ID constraints. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nFSR method with Identity Decoupling and Fitting (IDFSR), designed to enhance ID\nrestoration under large scaling factors while mitigating hallucination effects.\nOur approach involves three key designs: 1) \\textbf{Masking} the facial region\nin the low-resolution (LR) image to eliminate unreliable ID cues; 2)\n\\textbf{Warping} a reference image to align with the LR input, providing style\nguidance; 3) Leveraging \\textbf{ID embeddings} extracted from ground truth (GT)\nimages for fine-grained ID modeling and personalized adaptation. We first\npretrain a diffusion-based model to explicitly decouple style and ID by forcing\nit to reconstruct masked LR face regions using both style and identity\nembeddings. Subsequently, we freeze most network parameters and perform\nlightweight fine-tuning of the ID embedding using a small set of target ID\nimages. This embedding encodes fine-grained facial attributes and precise ID\ninformation, significantly improving both ID consistency and perceptual\nquality. Extensive quantitative evaluations and visual comparisons demonstrate\nthat the proposed IDFSR substantially outperforms existing approaches under\nextreme degradation, particularly achieving superior performance on ID\nconsistency.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scaling", "scale"], "score": 2}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["consistency", "fine-grained"], "score": 2}}, "source_file": "2025-08-18.jsonl"}

Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs)\nto generate shared, group-level distractors by learning common error patterns\nacross large student populations. However, such distractors often fail to\ncapture the diverse reasoning errors of individual students, limiting their\ndiagnostic effectiveness. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of\npersonalized distractor generation, which aims to generate tailored distractors\nbased on individual misconceptions inferred from each student's past\nquestion-answering (QA) records, ensuring every student receives options that\neffectively exposes their specific reasoning errors. While promising, this task\nis challenging because each student typically has only a few QA records, which\noften lack the student's underlying reasoning processes, making training-based\ngroup-level approaches infeasible. To overcome this, we propose a training-free\ntwo-stage framework. In the first stage, we construct a student-specific\nmisconception prototype by applying Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to recover\nthe student's reasoning trajectories from past incorrect answers. In the second\nstage, this prototype guides the simulation of the student's reasoning on new\nquestions, enabling the generation of personalized distractors that align with\nthe student's recurring misconceptions.

With AI, we can now extract detailed\nmeasurements of size, shape, and fat content from abdominal structures in 3D\nclinical imaging at scale. This creates an opportunity to empirically define\nbody composition signatures linked to type 2 diabetes risk and protection using\nlarge-scale clinical data. Approach: To uncover BMI-specific diabetic abdominal\npatterns from clinical CT, we applied our design four times: once on the full\ncohort (n = 1,728) and once on lean (n = 497), overweight (n = 611), and obese\n(n = 620) subgroups separately. Briefly, our experimental design transforms\nabdominal scans into collections of explainable measurements through\nsegmentation, classifies type 2 diabetes through a cross-validated random\nforest, measures how features contribute to model-estimated risk or protection\nthrough SHAP analysis, groups scans by shared model decision patterns\n(clustering from SHAP) and links back to anatomical differences\n(classification). Results: The random-forests achieved mean AUCs of 0.72-0.74.\nThere were shared type 2 diabetes signatures in each group; fatty skeletal\nmuscle, older age, greater visceral and subcutaneous fat, and a smaller or\nfat-laden pancreas. Univariate logistic regression confirmed the direction of\n14-18 of the top 20 predictors within each subgroup (p < 0.05). Conclusions:\nOur findings suggest that abdominal drivers of type 2 diabetes may be\nconsistent across weight classes.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-08-18.jsonl"}

However, monocular\nendoscope pose estimation and tissue reconstruction face persistent challenges,\nincluding depth ambiguity, physiological tissue deformation, inconsistent\nendoscope motion, limited texture fidelity, and a restricted field of view. To\novercome these limitations, a unified framework for monocular endoscopic tissue\nreconstruction that integrates scale-aware depth prediction with\ntemporally-constrained perceptual refinement is presented. This framework\nincorporates a novel MAPIS-Depth module, which leverages Depth Pro for robust\ninitialisation and Depth Anything for efficient per-frame depth prediction, in\nconjunction with L-BFGS-B optimisation, to generate pseudo-metric depth\nestimates. These estimates are temporally refined by computing pixel\ncorrespondences using RAFT and adaptively blending flow-warped frames based on\nLPIPS perceptual similarity, thereby reducing artefacts arising from\nphysiological tissue deformation and motion. To ensure accurate registration of\nthe synthesised pseudo-RGBD frames from MAPIS-Depth, a novel WEMA-RTDL module\nis integrated, optimising both rotation and translation. Finally, truncated\nsigned distance function-based volumetric fusion and marching cubes are applied\nto extract a comprehensive 3D surface mesh.

In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for\nmulti-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is\nmotivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains\nproduce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when\noperating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base\nmodel than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two\nobservations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario,\nwhich nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method\noperates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing\ncosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base\nmodel. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight\nmatrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain\ndrift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that\nincorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition.
