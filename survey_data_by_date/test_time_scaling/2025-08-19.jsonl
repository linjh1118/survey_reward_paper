In this work, we analyze specific properties which make a benchmark\nmore reliable for such decisions, and interventions to design higher-quality\nevaluation benchmarks. We introduce two key metrics that show differences in\ncurrent benchmarks: signal, a benchmark's ability to separate better models\nfrom worse models, and noise, a benchmark's sensitivity to random variability\nbetween training steps. We demonstrate that benchmarks with a better\nsignal-to-noise ratio are more reliable when making decisions at small scale,\nand those with less noise have lower scaling law prediction error. These\nresults suggest that improving signal or noise will lead to more useful\nbenchmarks, so we introduce three interventions designed to directly affect\nsignal or noise. For example, we propose that switching to a metric that has\nbetter signal and noise (e.g., perplexity rather than accuracy) leads to better\nreliability and improved scaling law error. We also find that filtering noisy\nsubtasks, to improve an aggregate signal-to-noise ratio, leads to more reliable\nmulti-task evaluations. We also find that averaging the output of a model's\nintermediate checkpoints to reduce noise leads to consistent improvements. We\nconclude by recommending that those creating new benchmarks, or selecting which\nexisting benchmarks to use, aim for high signal and low noise.

Although post-training quantization(PTQ)\nprovides an effective pathway for accelerating sampling, the iterative nature\nof diffusion models causes stepwise quantization errors to accumulate\nprogressively during generation, inevitably compromising output fidelity. To\naddress this challenge, we develop a theoretical framework that mathematically\nformulates error propagation in Diffusion Models (DMs), deriving per-step\nquantization error propagation equations and establishing the first closed-form\nsolution for cumulative error. Building on this theoretical foundation, we\npropose a timestep-aware cumulative error compensation scheme.

To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel CNN-based algorithm called SFAC, i.e., Structure-preserving Feature\nAlignment Colorizer. SFAC is trained on only two images for old photo\ncolorization, eliminating the reliance on big data and allowing direct\nprocessing of the old photo itself to overcome the domain gap problem. Our\nprimary objective is to establish semantic correspondence between the two\nimages, ensuring that semantically related objects have similar colors. We\nachieve this through a feature distribution alignment loss that remains robust\nto different metric choices. However, utilizing robust semantic correspondence\nto transfer color from the reference to the old photo can result in inevitable\nstructure distortions. To mitigate this, we introduce a structure-preserving\nmechanism that incorporates a perceptual constraint at the feature level and a\nfrozen-updated pyramid at the pixel level.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task of joint\negocentric video and human motion generation, characterized by two key\nchallenges: 1) Viewpoint Alignment: the camera trajectory in the generated\nvideo must accurately align with the head trajectory derived from human motion;\n2) Causal Interplay: the synthesized human motion must causally align with the\nobserved visual dynamics across adjacent video frames. To address these\nchallenges, we propose EgoTwin, a joint video-motion generation framework built\non the diffusion transformer architecture. Specifically, EgoTwin introduces a\nhead-centric motion representation that anchors the human motion to the head\njoint and incorporates a cybernetics-inspired interaction mechanism that\nexplicitly captures the causal interplay between video and motion within\nattention operations. For comprehensive evaluation, we curate a large-scale\nreal-world dataset of synchronized text-video-motion triplets and design novel\nmetrics to assess video-motion consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the EgoTwin framework.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_rl": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model for RL", "matched_keywords": ["alignment"], "score": 1}, "reward_model_benchmark": {"chapter_name": "Reward Model Benchmark", "matched_keywords": ["evaluation", "dataset", "consistency"], "score": 3}}, "source_file": "2025-08-19.jsonl"}

Unfortunately, these requirements are not easily addressed\nby human camera operators, who are in a hurry, impatient, or lack understanding\nof the scene structure and the photographic process. Existing approaches to\nguide humans during image acquisition concentrate on single objects or neglect\nview-dependent material characteristics. We propose a novel situated\nvisualization technique for scanning at multiple scales. During the scanning of\na scene, our method identifies important objects that need extended image\ncoverage to properly represent view-dependent appearance.
