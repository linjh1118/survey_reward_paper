However, their deployment is hindered by the significant\ncomputational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view\nimages, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.\nThis overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during\nencoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the\nquadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose\nPrune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs\nin autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a\ndiversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,\nwhich prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than\nrelying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller\nthat learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their\nimportance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does\nnot require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible\nwith modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two\nlarge-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that\nPrune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining\nor improving task performance.

We represent such\nmulti-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection\nof perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be\nregistered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach\nwhere the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D\npoint in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a\ndirection vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation\nw.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from\ncorrespondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,\nthese form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised\ncameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved\nreconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the\nadditional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a\ndeformed object.

We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically\ndesigned to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the\ncoarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent\nspace, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models.\nWe introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial\ncorrespondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while\npreserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match\nthe characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively\nenhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,\nfrom single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while\nmaintaining efficiency in training.", "survey_categories": {"test_time_scaling": {"chapter_name": "Test-Time Scaling", "matched_keywords": ["scale"], "score": 1}}, "source_file": "2025-08-20.jsonl"}
